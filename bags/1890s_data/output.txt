vol 1 bozeman montana may 30 1895 no 1 president james reid by h g phelps this being the first issue of our lege magazine we thought it ting to present to our readers a portrait of president james reid we teachers have  been associated with him now for one year and may truly say that we have a man at the head of this institution who is thoroughly interested in our work as instructors and always ready to give us telligent advice we clip the following from an article by f l kern in a recent issue of the rockies  with high honors from the famous mcgill university of montreal he studied ology two years in the union theological seminary new york city and also two  years in the presby thoroughly est and conscientious large hearted and sympathetic am tious and progressive these are the qualities backed by a broad and liberal education and fine culture with unusual executive ability that make president reid at once a leader and model among school men he is a native james reid a e terian college of montreal graduating from the course in theology and the arts and sciences he then spent one year in the e din bu r g h 
university and synod hall where he was called to bay city michigan where he spent several years in preaching and qs principal of the high school of that city spending the winter of 1889 in new york in post graduate work he came in the spring to montana taking charge of the college of montana at deer lodge and also the presbyterian church of that citv in the fall of 1891 he gave himself entirely to the work of the college which he sided over successfull v for years he of canada of scotcirish parentage beginning his higher cation at the collegiate institute of hamilton ontario he then attended the tor onto university but graduated in 1881 was president of the state council of tion for three years and i 11 1894 was dent of the state teachers association he has been years a member of the state 2 college exponent board of education and recognizing his executive and financial abilities in the management of the college at deer lodge that body placed him in charge of the state college at man an act highly approved by every citizen of montana the young men and women who place themselves under the influence and training of president reid will not only receive thorough and cal instruction in their scholastic studies but will get that higher and better preparation for lifes work the ethical psychical training that is so necessary to true manhood and womanhood a helpful education extracts from a recent address by luther foster m s a it has been claimed perhaps justly tion expand the lungs and strengththat the usual college education en and develop the muscles disqualifies one for the common the student is taught to appreciate avocations oflife that the tendency the dignity of that labor which is away from the industriesthe dues the wild unbroken prairie and home the store the shop and the makes it to blossom like the rose farmand out of sympathy with these which fashions into beauty and form everyday callings hence the result is the block of marble or wood which degradation of labor converts the grain of the field into our agricultural colleges seek to nourishing delicious food which overcome this mistake of other insticrowns the hill with the beatitv of tutions by giving to the masses a forestry and covers the valley broader knowledge one in sympathy fruitful grasses and golden grains with the pursuits of the people one the study of the natural sciences that shall keep awake all the business should come before all others one faculties of the mind while it broadens writer says the works of god their field of action and gives at the better worth study than the thoughts same time a dignityto every stroke of of man we are organic beings of labor the strong right arm may do flesh and blood walking the surface the best student is he who comof a planet in the solar system bines with a full well balanced brain rounded by solid liquid and gaseous perfect health and a sound well develbodies girt about with trees and oped body a noted english teacher  shrubs and herbs and mosses with puts it thus proper education and and birds and fishes and cultivation must be accompanied by sects on our knowledge of these and the health strength gayety and lightvttieir laws and properties depends our ness that come only of a sound body health our happiness our very cultivate every power apd muscle of ence through a study of these the body eye and hand wind and sciences the student of the new limb nature requires that we should  tion obtains the same mental drill work well and use our leisure well  ihqt heof the oldi line university got amusement should be the medicine of through the dead languages while at the soul by which we obtain rest the same time his mind is stored with the agricultural colleges make knowledge that will be of practical their industries a means of physical value to him in whatever business he development the iron and the wood may follow shops the laboratories the farm the there can be no question as to garden the orchard and the experwhich education is of greater value to iment field together with military the world today the knotty drill and various athletic games furnlems oflabor capital and hard money ish exercise varied and entertaining  demand for their solution not the while they train the eye to quick perintellect of the scholarly dreamer but ception the hand to skillfulmanipulathat of the alert active business man the by r e chandler m e 7 mong the interesting things that may be seen in the college workshop is a caliper this is a little instrument used for making exceedingly fine measurements it is capable of mining sizes to within andth part of an inch to give some idea of the extreme minuteness of such measurements i may state that a fine human hair is about one hundredth of an inch in diameter while the thickness of a sheet of nary foolscap is about one dred and fiftieth of an inch now agine this hair s

can have no better mendation than to be able to present an attractive letter   every business or out exception i think it fair to depends ultimately for any marked success upon a good reading writing and speaking knowledge of plain common english let the preacher be never so learned in the classics and theology and spired with a buining zeal for his fellowmen all this is vain unless he can readily and in a masterful way manage the vehiclecommon lishwhich transfers what he has and knows to the heads and hearts of his hearers the lawyer after all his study and technical learning must for practical success depend upon a choice and subtle diction that not a word may fail him in weaving an argument the scientist in whatsoever line less he can present in an attractive way a formal discussion of his work is so handicapped as to keep him always in the lower ranks of his profession grammar in the abstract is a bear that i little blame any student for avoiding it is a soulless study as it is commonlytaught but it can not be neglected nor can the other mechanical drill in the use of capitals and punctuation be slightedthere is no royal road however to read some good auth01 in class room work to call attention to his happy usage of certain words to study his manner of expression and note how he makes his sentences to note how easy it is to spoil and how difficult to improve one of them this incidental to a pleasant reading of an interesting story or poem will assist to a real and helpful knowledge of how to read how to speak how to write and how to appreciate

and the trees and grass within it and electric lights and street cars nough to fairly make it boom but ill tell you whattwas lacking in the proper education in scientific research and books and things like that till the agricultural college came chock full and brimming over with knowledge and professors and a president so pat yes bozeman has always been afairly middling city but a little too unsettledfirst way up and then way down always striving for the capital or something way beyond till the agricultural college came to town but now its settled down a bit and being educated and all its youth and maidens start early in the fall and they go through all the winter and the spring until the summer to this agricultural college where they learn to know it all and bozeman has prospered so

iological laboratory romn operating room class room and office also some stalls for animals which are to be operated upon  the shop building will be a fraine building 60 feet by 100 foet one story in height it rill contain the shop chinery forges etc it is probable that the heating pla1it for the college buildings vill also be located here the drill hall will be a building very similar to the shop bnilding and will be arranged so as to enable the tary department to continue its work without regard to the weather it is expected that these buildings wi11 be ready for occupancy in one years time by r e chandler rrhere is an old story of a gain made betveen a smith and one of his customers by this bargain the blacksmith was to receive for shoeing a horse one cent for the first nail two for the ond four for the the 
third and so on the charge for each nail being double that of the preceding one this might not at first seem a very exhorbitant charge but if we suppose the horse to be shod all round and that there were eight nails to each shoe the smiths bill would amount to the neat sum of 1099511627775 one can perhaps get an idea of the rapidity with which the sum of a geometrical series grows by means of another problem suppose an nary chess board be taken and one grain of wheat deposited for the first square two grains for the second four for the third and so on till the last or sixtyfourth square is reached how many grains will it take here the amount will evidentlv be the sum of a geometrical series of which the first term is 1 and the last 2 raised to the sixtyfourth power and amounts to the enormous number of 184467 44073 709551615 grains to obtain some faint idea of this number we might take a sample of wheat and weigh it counting the number of grains and then calculate the number of grains in a bushel we should then find that a bushel of wheat contained between 600000 and 700000 grains now the wheat crop for the entire united states is in the neighborhood of 400000000 bushels then plying this by the number of grains in a bushel and dividing it into the ber we have obtained as the answer of our problem we see that it would take the entire crop of the united states for a period of over 60000 years to furnish the required number of grains short course in agriculture by s m emery quick action is oftentimes sary to success this course has been embodied in the lege curriculum to meet the wants of a large class of citizens who by the nature of things are precluded from the regular courses of study beyond question in many lars the prevalent style of farming in montana is out of joint with the times the work period is not fully distributed rigorously exacting as it is during seed time and harvest there is but little to do on the farm during the winter months until isting conditions are changed to what better purpose can the ive farmer apply this period of ed leisure than in study and how can this study be better conducted than under the auspices of the college of agriculture with those of the lege faculty who by special tion are peculiarly fitted to instruct in that will be of immediate value to the farmer student in the first years course are animal my animal physiology dairying mal hygiene small fruits orcharding and shop work in the second years course diseases of farm animals eral agriculture farm accounts mentary botany irrigation ing and tree planting and animal feeding these are in the main practical mon sense subjects and in considering them the average man might say of animal feeding for example i stand that why should i be ed to receive further information on the matter true the farmer undercollege exponent 3 stands supplying the wants of his c1eatures so that they do not at least  often snffer from the pangs of hunger but is there a farmer in montana day who can tell the cost per pound of the pork he is fitting for market or who knows from personal experience that feed which will produce the est gain at the least expense if this be the case is it not a ous undertaking to be prosecuting a business with the financial aspects of which one is in total ignorance the same may be said of all the studies embraced within the course the course is flexible in that each student may make selection of such branches as may seem most desirable to him in addition to the purely ricultural studies the college classes in the english branches are also open to those taking the short course without extra charge by degrees the college is acqmrmg a fine library many of the books therein being the best procurable on these subjects this together with files embracing more than a hundred of the leading agricultural publications and state papers are at the service of thbse attending college this intensely practical course is signed to meet the wants of those to whom both time and money are jects an entrance fee of 10 pays all tuition expenses for the full college year and the complete course is ed in two terms for two years the fall term beginning october 15 1895 and the winter term january 6 1896 the president and faculty extend a cordial invitation to those interested in better farm methods to attend food by f w traphagen the extent to which the ating of food is carried on at the present day is appalling three main purposes exist for the practice the first being a desire to sell an inferior article for a superior one a cheaper one for a more expensive the second reason being due to a desire to improve the appearance of an article as in the coloring of candy the ing of tea bleaching of molasses and whitening of bread and the presence of adulterants may be traced also to the additions made to the food or erage to prevent fermentative change as examples we have the borax in milk and butter the salicylic acid in beer and the sulphite of lime in cider adulterations may be considered as consisting of two kinds harmless ones which only effect a fraud upon tle pocketbook and harmful ones which seriously affect the health the value of the food yearly sumed in the united states is erably above 450000000000 and it is estimated that this is adulterated to the extent of at least two per cent which is equivalent to ninety millions of dollars this remember is the most conservative estimate of this two per cent of adulteration about ninety per cent is nonprejudicial to health ninety millions of dollars are stolen every year by men who make fortunes by ch ea ting the consumer pepper and spices are adulterated with burnt meal buckwheat hulls ground cocoanut shells etc of the various spices recently examined in massachusetts more than twothirds of the samples of black pepper were found to be adulterated of ninetyone samples of cloves seventysix were adulterated and in another case all the lots of cloves were adulterated in dairy products the principal teration consists in adding water to milk which when pure is nearly tenths water in adding lard or beef tallow to butter and in selling margarine for butter oleomargarine in itself 
is not objectionable being of necessity cleanly made but when it is sold for the much more expensive ar4 college exponent ticle butter then we are defrauded the laws of most states require that all oleomargarine sold shall be plainly marked as such and not represented to be butter lard has the cheaper stearine ton seed oil etc added to it baking powder contains besides the proper constituents an unnecessary amount of flour or starch also alum plaster of paris etc which are cidedly unwholesome molasses has been found to contain tin in a recent examination three samples out of sixtyeight ed a considerable amount of this metal in a soluble form syrup of cane sugar and glucose are frequently added to honey even our medicines are not what they should be recently only three per cent of a large number of drugs was found to be good quality candies are frequently colored with pigments which are very able from the hygienic standpoint efforts are being put forth in many of the states to check

w m cobleigh many people in the united states are familiar with the fact that military tion is given to the students of ent colleges throughout our country at the expense of the government but the number who know to what extent it is carried on and who really appreciate the advantages derived from such instruction both by the government and the students selves is very small in july 1866 congress passed an act which read as follows that for the purpose of promoting know1edge of military science among the young men of our countrythepresident may upon the application of an ed college or university within the its of the united states with sufficient capacity to educate at one time not less than 150 students detail an cer of the army to act as president superintendent or professor of such college or university that the ber of officers so detailed shall not ceed twenty at any time and shall be apportioned throughout the united states as nearly as practicable cording to population and shall be governed by general rules to be scribed from time to time by the dent this was merely an experiment and proved to be so successful and so well appreciated by the leading educators of our country that at different times the number of officers detailed to leges has been increased so that in 1892 seventyfive officers of the lar army were giving instruction in military science and tactics to the young men of our different tions in addition to this number were ten officers of the navy detailed to colleges situated in the sea port towns giving instruction in naval gineering when a college receives the detail of an officer the government ly furnishes all articles of ordnance the institution giving bond for twice their value on entering upon his duties the fessor of military science becomes a member of the faculty and in addition to his military work may give tion in some other branch of study he also has charge of the tion and government of the cadets college exponent 5 and the appointment of officers he also sees that at all military tions proper discipline is enforced and in case of misconduct assigns such punishment as may seem best he is required to make a quarterly report to the adjutant general of the army giving the number who are receiving military instruction the number who are capable of receiving such tion the number of drills and tions in tactics per week and the age attendance at same the names of the cadets who have shown special tact for performance of military duty shall be placed on the united states army register an officer from the inspector als department of the army visits the college at the close of each year he ascertains how the military ment has been conducted if the cadets have been properly instructed and if the rest of the college faculty have given their support to the military structor in charge the instruction is both practical and theoretical the practical part embraces the executing the ments as given in the new drill regulations of the army including the school of the soldier squad drill onet exercise and skirmish drill also it embraces target practice and nel duty in fact the cadet has brought before him as far as possible everything that makes up the life of the soldier in time of peace this kind of work mixed in with the everyday labors of class room is refreshing to the student who wise would not seek such recreation the theoretical instruction consists in lectures given personally by the professor of military science and tics on subjects pertaining to the art of war organization and support of armies he also conducts recitations on the drill regulations of the army at which the cadet is required to plain any part of the regulations as is done when a company is under drill thus the student not only becomes familar with the practical but also with the theoretical part of military science this knowledge in case our country becomes involved in war can then be put to still more

by f w traphagen of the college of agriculture and mechanic arts of bozeman montana was printed in the scientific american for larch 7th i will give the corresrondence as it is in the above paper to the editor of the scientific a1ierican in repeating the experiments of mr crumbie des0ribed in the electrical world i obtained a negative with several images of the coins and keys used lieeling satisfied that the objects cuuld not have moved while under the influence of the current i exposed a plate to the action of several keys and coins but without the use of the induction coil or any exterior current whatever  now while i have seea numerous accounts of the results obtained by use of metallic objects inside the closed dry plate holder without the aig of the electric currerit i have failed to note any account of the same effect being obtained without the current or a crookes tube or electric lamp or something external is it possible that the effect of metals on the dry plat6 has not been noted this effsct let it be well understood ls similar to the roentgen effect not a tioij under the metal but the reverse the reduction taking place around the objects the film under the objects remaining unchanged and washing out in the hypo giving the shadows a coin and a piece of cardboard when placed together on the dry plate both gave  shadows great care was taken to prevent access of light and the plate and holder re mained in the dark room during the whole experiment thoroughly shielded light if this matter has not b8en brought to the attention of the public i would be glad if you will use the data i have sent you f w traphagen the editor of the scientific american says the images of the keys and coins in the photographs received from prof hagen are as clear and distinct as those in any of the radiographs we have published1 since this article was published the doctor has tried several experiments to ascertain what the cause of the phenomena was he placed a piece of glass between two pieces of metal on the dry plate and got a photograph of the glass as well as the metals thus showing the glass to be opaque to the rays he also found that metallic stances were necessary to produce an image and that if a piece of zinc and a piece of platinum were placed on the plate an image of both was obtained also if a number of substances of any kind which were opaque to roentgen rays were placed on the plate along with the metals an image of these was also produced now the metals being in contact with the gelatine film of the dry plate produces a condition of the ether wav6s probably the same as the condition when roentgen rays are produced and as far as the experiment has been conducted the doctor has every reason to believe the effects produced are caused by roentgen rays by the suggestion of capt geo s son the secretary of interior recommended that lice11se be issued e v blankenship and 0 p morgan of the college to transport camping parties through the yellowstone national park during the season of 1896 we wish messrs blankenship and morgan the best of success in their undertaking and feel assured that any one wishing to make the park tour this season will be more than pleased with the accomodations and ment received from these gentlemen all the leading colleges in america are giviug credit for work done by students on college pape1s this seews a very able move as a great deal of time is needed to look after the interests of the paper and make it a success besides the practice one gets in getting up a paper is of far more worth than anything he probably would get in the same time spent in school work 4 college exponent western vs eastern college education w t shaw alarge number of our western students seem to have an dinate desire to go east to co1lege this migration of western students to the eastern colleges has given the impression among eastern people that our institutions are of a very inferior grade even amo11g our own people vrho have never attended ern institutions some carry the lief that a liberal education can be obtained only in the east this has gone so far that students leaving here for the east are not ognized at all in an educational way but having spent a fruitless year in  an eastern college return to be looked upon as a scholar why yes hes been east to college this prestige attained in the east induces many of our students to go there to school even though they are a ware their education will be sacrificed to a tain extent prestige is good but real worth is better prestige without ability is quite often a detriment we believe the time is here when people will not recognize your college sheepskin and degrees and what you have done seen and learned but rather what you can do of course we do not mean to sav that prestige is obtained in the east and real knowledge only in the west but this much we do claim that in the courses we do give special tion to there seems to be no good reason whv our students cannot do better work here at home than at an eastern school the same idea in the east among students that they must go to germany or france to study while there is certainly a ity in this movement no one rho knows the real condition of affairs in these two cases will dare say but that the thing is overdone to a ing degree in speaking of the west we wish to include strictly the newer western states excluding california true we cannot at present finish a doctor or a minister nor can we fit one for several of the pursuits of life such as a manufacturer or any following which is limited to eastern industries so well as can the east but the idea of our students going east to prepare themselves for carrying on our tries should be disabused as rapidly as possible as will be as soon as our master workmen show a preference to home education which they are doing todayto a good extent in the first place our institutions are not oping their education in the line of to such an alarming degree as some of the eastern colleges are certainly athletics are quite a essary factor in a college course esptcially so in the east where the body must be more carefully attended to than in the west the invigorating climate permits stdents to study harder more hours with less exercise and keep a stronger healthier body and mind than in any other part of the union consequently athletics will not be couraged to such an extent that the acquisition of knowledge shall be materially impaired the utterly helpless and impractical condition m which a large precentage of eastern graduates enter the field of practical life should he a warning to students who expect to receive direct means of support from their tion even though they are not obliged to use their education as a means of support we believe bnes faculties become more thoroughly developed a higher standard of life established a broader knowledge of human college exponent 5 nature gajned throgh education designed for a life certainly we recogmze that eral of the languaes elementary sciences mtthematlcs etc should be first attained before enterinoa techmcal course our colleges do this to a full degree but here stop their students givm them the pression that they are fitted to enter practical life  one great trouble with the co11eges of today is that they try to graduate students too young and that they make too much of a general college education another defect is that they try to do too much in a four years course the student gets a s
mattering of many things but no one thing thorough especia1ly is this tbe case with eastern institutions technical courses are becoming more popular among young men each vear classical courses are rapidly losing ground most of our western students when they go east to take a technical course rarely ever think of staying there after their course is finished then why do they lose their tunity of studying at home when their interests are where thev will find the courses all practical drrectly applicable to the profession they are preparing for where they will meet with instructors who know the sources of the country its possibilities and its probabilities take an example for instance chemistry or metallurgy one not take up more than one branch of either of these studies and do it tice in a practical way then if you are preparing to be a metallurgist in our western mining districts why not attend school where your line of work is taught and discussed among the students professors and mining men here you can learn the geology minerologygeographyetc of the place in which you intend to live and work the same is true of chemistry if you will become a chemist dont get your head full of methods for iron and steel analysis or learn all about the manufacture of gun cotton soap or dye stuffs and then come west pecting to go directly into practical chemical work the principle is this wherever you find a technical school you will find its teachings its collections its library its sentiments strongly ored with the surrounding indutries this is natural and the natural result is that students low in the same line now i have taken chemistry and metallurgry as a type to illustrate the principle but most of the fessions and trades can be shown to come under the same course of mg if one expects to become proficient in any line of research he must begin to study conditions as early as possible and not loose four or five of his years in a country foreign to his field of research thev sav that it takes several acquaintance with the nature of our western business men to be a successful one yourself if this is so it would take even more time to be able to handle our mining men i believe that every thorough going western man will agree with me on this principle that if a student wishes to become a factor in ing the resources of the west he should be educated here and should lose no time in the eastern co1leges fitting himself for a candidate for the foot ball team 6 college exponent educational motives lucy stafford the opinion is prevalent among many persons that education is only to be desired to gain a livelihood or to earn a greater amount of money than could otherwise be obtained and if it is not seen to be a direct means to these mercenary ends the time spent in acquiring an education is thought to be wasted for those who intend to follow some profession or become teachers the direct use of education is ent but what of the numbers of people who must spend the greater part of their lives in manual labor all cannot have professions or be teachers and scientists are we to say that gaining of knowledge is to belong to these few alone many people dislike to give their time and money to a thing from which they can see no immediately accruing benefit some of the tiest forces at work in the world do their work so quietly that we see the results and do not realize the source from which they came so it is with education we see results of it every day in better government greater civilization and better general tone of life no onecan possibly have an tion without using it no matter what obscure part of the world he may habit or what lowly occupation gives him his livlihood people who live must think this is one of natures established laws and these thoughts are the precursors of their actions true education is a development of the mind so that every thought we have and everv act we do are enced by it an educated person does not hold the same opinions or the same reasons for his opinions that he would if he were not educated the mind is extended by education and prejudice must give way to logical thought and reasoning we must not if we would see the benefits of education compare one man who is not educated with other who is because nature has not given to all equal talents to begin with but we must take a man out an education and give him an education and the difference it makes will be speedily seen it is the people in the world who make it and if we would reform the world we must reform its people and the best wav to do this is to educate them so that they will be susceptible to the influence of reform the est foe that any reform ever had was prejudice and the only way to move it is bv education one of the greatest attainments given by education is  adaptibility if we have this quality we may rule circumstances if we do not rise a hove conditions we bhall be trolled by them if we cannot adapt our minds to the minds of others we can have no interest with no sympathy hence no influence our greatest work aud inspiration lies in our influence with others can there be a better investment for anyone be he farmer or fisherman miner or merchant than a good education it is capital deposited in a bank that never fails and always pays interest on amounts invested in our progressive age when we have such advantages for practical education is taking the place of old time theory it is to be hoped that the time will come when all will realize the benefits of education for those who are not going to use in a direct manner the training received at lege and none will say to the earnest student you are wasting your time you will never use the knowledge you are now gaining college exponent 7 in the northwest e v blankenship in the great northwestern part of the united states there are very few well established colleges at present and the reason ma be understood by those who have given their attention to the natural opment of the country it requires tile for a country to become m every respect yet 1t is remarkable to note how well vanced the west is at present owing to the short time that these states and largest cities have had to ulate their governments in order to meet the emergencies imposed upon them by the rapid increase in tion if the first inhabitants who came to the northwest had turned their whole attention to the building of factories colleges etc it is quite likely that the country would have been more advanced than  it is at present but the first civilized people who faced the danger of the western plains engaged themselves more in the accumulation of wealth than in the interests of education the pioneers were not lookingward to the prosperity of the country that was represented to them by lonesome mountain peaks and valeys with herds of wild game and tribes of warlike indians but with their watchful eyes they were constantly on the lookout for treacherous indians or for some game with which they might satisfy their hunger or else their time was ployed in climbing oer the rugged with wistful eye trying to get a glimpse of some treasure that nature had providentially stored away so it is not a mystery why the northwest is not well supplied with famous educational institutions at first there must be a demand for colleges before it is necessary for the people to take an interest in their upbuilding and che time has come when such institutions are in demand throughout the northwest their value may be appreciated especially in giving aid to the country in the progress it is making toward that high degree of civilization a century should increase in wealth as well as iu population before it should assume the responsibility 0 supporting great educational tutions institutions cannot become great in a short time only in structure though their domes may pierce the etherial waves and their system of government may be as perfect as of those elsewhere they must follow the natural order of slow growth in establishing a reputation the agricultural college of the state of montana has a promising future and from year to year if the representation of the young people of the state is as liberal as it is at present there is no doubt but that the college will gain distinction in the near future there are people who think that the agricultuaal college is an tution for the purpose of turning out graduates equipped only for the management of the farm but the courses of study as given in the logues are about as complete as you will find in the other training tutions of the land it seemed to be the general sion in a neighboring college town that the students of the agricultural co11ege all joined in with the sors in raising and gathering in the products of the farm representing that phase oflife prior to 1860 when plantations flourished throughout the south it happened to be the fortune of one of our professors to pay a visit to the neighboring lege town anrl while there enjoying 8 college exponent himself the question was asked how soon are you going to gather in your pumpkins our young sor was like the boy who had au elephant on his hands but after the feeling of embnrrassment had ceased he kindly informed the questioner that as long as the agricultural lege receives its share of the ment appropriations he would not be compelled to gather in his kins but could hire them pulled and stored away  the financial resources of the lege are not pumpkin raising as it may be generally understood nor are the students and professors compelled to pull the pumpkins after they have been raised though the experiment station is an institution in tion with the college that is expected to further the agricultural interests in the state of montana the northwest has a broad area that must be recognized for its nence in the near future montana though a small portion of the west ranks among the first states of the union in stock raising and in agriculture its mineral output compares ably with any state or nation of its size on the earth but there are other openings that are of as much ance to the welfare of the country as that of the accumulation of wealth one is for literary fame it is not probable that the broad and fertile fields of the northwest will continue to yield only the same kind of ducts in the future that they have in past but history is likely to repeat itself and the northwest will be taken into consideration in order to further the literary interests of any country there must be good educational institutions could addison swift or steele have ever gained the eminence they did without the support and influence of such institutions as trinity edenburgh and oxford it is possible but not probable a general interest must besh0wn by the people in order that the colleges of the north west may compete with those in the eastern part of the united states and across the sea if the people will give their aid to the colleges then the colleges in turn for the favor will do their part in promoting the interests of tion it is not assuming on our part to fix a high mark for the northwest to attain in the near future it has reached the maximum degree in many respects that could be expected of any country to attain in the same length of time if its own people do not look forward with high aspirations it is not likely that others will and as the country has become known and respected for its existing state of advancement we may hope for its educational advancement the tide that conveys literary cess to the northwest will be comed when it comes though at present it may be remote and slowly drifting the descriptive art lucy stafford ilt is curious to note how few people are able to give a good telligent description of anything if they attempt to describe a thing they give you a hazy indistinct idea and your conception of the object they are tryingto describe is confused instead of being made clearer this defect in description is most monly due to a lack of observation we think that we know what the things about us look like but our college exponent 9 know ledge of them is indistinct we are continually some nterestino thmgs and m so domg 1 b b h b neglect the common t mgs w 1c we view every day you ask a person what the pattern of the wall paper is in his own room or to descnbe the carvings on his bookcase most likely he be to your quest10n or to give the tion though he sees these things day likewise you ask him to tell you what his friend looks like and no doubt his description would appiy equally well to a dozen sons whom you know the main thing in a good descriiitin pointing out of the dlstmgmshmg marks which separate the described individual from others of the same class an observing person is tinually finding resemblances and differences when be sees a certain object he instantly thinks of what he has seen before that is similar to this and wherein they are alike and in what respects they differ on the other hand there are sons who though they have a clear idea themselves are unable to convey it to others because they have not a good command of language they are very much like the little boy who was asked to define salt and gave the following salt is the stuff that makes your potatoesnot taste good when you forget to put any in he evidently knew what salt was but he could nol give to others the knowledge he possessed in our good literature we find many delightful descriptions which give a seeming reality to fiction and establish fact much more firmly in our minds there are two general kinds of description the minute careful description which gives each part so clearly with its relations to the other parts that we seem to see the completed whole and we eel that if we should see the object we should know it instantly this kind of cription is like the view we get of a mountain when we are very near to it then though we cannot see the whole of it we see within the range of our vision each tree and rock and from the minute examination of a part are able to judge of the ance of the mountain from any point of view this kind of description is more fitting to use in describing small things and should be used when we wish to give others an idea of the actual appearance of a thing the other kind of description is more general it gives the striking characteristics and leaves tion to fill in the details it may be compared to a mountain seen from a great distance where we gei only the general outlines this method is very effective in describing large objects and is often used to convey the idea of the effect things have on the son viewing them rather than their actual appearance the descriptive art is one that serves more attention than is often given to it all people cannot see things for themselves and it would be well if we had more careful observers who could not only see a thing for themselves but make others to see it with them 10 college exponent    mrs marshall is giving the art class a course of lectures a committee of the college faculty is at work on the revision of the courses of study if you dont

f this faculty being well developed the world moves onward through its agency certainly we do not say that this is the only faculty necessary to do all this but one having this faculty will have ambition to get more knowledge and put what be does know to the best advantage while one lacking this faculty rriay ever so good an education and will never amount t
o thing here is a reason why so many people of an inferior grade of learning quite often get the best positions and generally the best of anything book learning is apt to repress this faculty so we find some of our best students and brightest men in very humble positions now as this faculty is so necessary in every persons life why do we show our ignorance of what is a virtue by trying to make everyone keep his head hanging as though he had stolen a sheep certainly it can be overdone and often is so is every faculty and activity of the mind many are overdone to such an extent that the owners are being ruined inch by inch and every one knows it but this harmless faculty many abhor to see it in another person quite a stir was produced among the college students and in the neighboring vicinity last week by a number of college professors resigning their positions this move was quite a surprise to all the students and many are lamenting that their highly regarded and much esteemed professors are to leave them all the students seem to feel that some cf their best friends and instructors are leaving them in the early part of their college training al though students will ever antagonize the professors to a certain extent in the class room there are but a few students having natural affection who have not formed ties of friendship and who find it hard to see their teachers leave the college for some better and more prominent position we are all moving upward and onward students graduate and leave for higher goals so we must not expect our professors to be contented always with present conditions college exponent 15 a real coquette charles patterson o annal youre sweet but far from complete lam strong in the latter conclusion for many a day ive wooed at youre

richly deserves among the many newspapers of the state which gave us a help none gave the publication so thorough a criticism as the editor of the helena independent he seemed to enter into the spirit of the whole paper as well as appreciate the desires and moods of a college student it was very encouraging to find an editor of a newspaper becorne so interested in college affairs and education apart from a financial or political point of view it is our aim with the help of all interested to set forth college life in the ivest and bring to more prom1nence the necessity of a practical 2 college exponent education to every citizen of the state besides we wish to show to the people of the state that they can get a practical scientific classical or ness education here in the west as easy and accomplish more for the same length of time than they can by going to the eastern institutions the last terms work by the dents show a great advance from the previous fall term less failures and better satisfaction all around this term so far though very short will show that the students are getting down to close work and will make a good showing considering the fact that nearly all students get the spring fever or bicycle malady the next issue of the exponent will be out about the 5th of june this will be onr last effort for this school year and we hope to place before the people interested in the exponent and college our best efforts this will contain all the notices for the mencement exercises and give a sume of the whole college year work to the advertisers of the exponent and to those who think our tion must have a very limited tion we will kindly inform you that we get out 2500 copies each month and will probably put out 3500 in our june issue now that the weather has probably settled and the ground has been dry for some time it is time our were in the field practicing for field day there is no reason why our bicyclists should not make a good record this spring as we must have some swift riders judging from the talk they have been putting up the past winter the track is in good shape and if you expect to do thing this season practice must soon commence how is it the captain of the baseball team has not rustled his crew out long before this previous to this year the college has made no special efforts to secure specimens for a museum however as we will soon have our new buildings in shape and will have roorn for the proper exhibition of such any natural history specimens that will be sent to the college will be highly valued and due recognition will be given to the parties sending although the college has made no special efforts in this line we have a good start at present our ical collection is quite extensive already having the fine exhibit of mrs moor at the worlds fair along with several other collections the flora of the state is well represented but our mineral collection is by far the best of any and will probably surpass any in the state since the extensive and very choice collection of dr traphagen has been purchased by the college we have no reason to complain about our min eralogical division of the museum we also have a quite extensive shoing in paleontology the silurian devonian and carboniferous ages being well represented in brate fossils most of these were also purchased of dr traphagen dr williams has a fine lot of tological specimens and preparations for the microscope it is our purpose to extend our lection as rapidly as possible after the new museum rooms are ready especially will an effort be made to have a good geological collection of the whole state as the subject of geology is exceptionally interesting here in the mountains nearly all the known formations can be found here college exponent 3 athletics in eastern colleges w t shaw the rush and rage of athletic sports are now the topics of all our college papers a colleges tation seems to be dependent upon the success of its athletes they are the object of of study of suit and of thenwhole souls are cast v1th these pursmts their ideals and day themselves through tern ble efforts and training reaching the goal just a trifle ahead of some noted athlete what shall we say of them and their ambitions whatever we say they will probably retort that we have soured because we can make no showing here in the west in these lines that if we had a good team we would be as pr ud of it as any college is of theirs in answer let me say there is no reason for such a retort as we can furmsh as good as any part of the world if we would take the matter up and train as do the stud e
n ts of the east no the reason why we do not all orow up to athletics is that here you find the desire for wealth so much tronger than in the east here the people of all classes of all tions with but few exceptions are not contented with what thev have there is a mad rush for money the students get the fever early in life all young and old a
re looking into the future for a fortune this motive true has caused a great deal of crime and confirmed to a certain extent the old saying the love of monev is the source of all evil but agiin it is the direct cause of the resources of the vest being so thoroughly developed it is the cause of some of the greatest engineering feats the world has known it has made the people perous daring and is bringing the west into the first ranks as regards learning and educ a ti on al influence  did it ever occur to a college graduate who finished with athletic ors that the reason why he could find nothing to do when he entered practical life was that he could do nothing he was not trained in the line of work where he would like to take the responsibility men who can do well always find something to do if they are capable did it ever occur to an athlete vho worshiped and looked with such reverence upon those people they are wont to call massive brained that they were ordinary beings who had acquired all by hard study close application selfdfnial and tiring energy there is too much nowadays laid on genius one of the best arguments there is against colleges running to excess in athletic sports is that the great object in life should be to develop every faculty and fit one for the destiny for which he was brought into this world if he fails in this he has failed in all a c
ollege education should at least start one upon this road and prepare him for study and development which will lead to this end hence if our colleges will all run to excess in one direction we cannot expect to develop the harmonious citizens and practical educated men we w

itle while under the other the title is as good and the money which ivould be wasted in freehold is in possession of the selector all this you can see is plainly in the direction of the singletax ideal as advocated by henry george a bill granting local bodies power to levy rates on unimproved values passed the lower house last year b

pendent upon them and not that the people are dependent upon the affairs of government the people constute the master and it must be fully appreciated by them that peace and prosperity in the commonwealth pends upon the majority acting in concert according to the instructions of honest welldisciplined men in order to bring about the ed reform the people must utilize their time in a suitable manner it should be the aim of the young men of the coming generation to strive for a noble purpose they should fully realize that time and energy properly used means an ational profit to the world every young man should establish a cient amount of confidence in himself to take some position on the social and moral questions of the clay the world may honor him for the declation of certain principles even if he should incidentally propose some ancient idea or perceive of something new which would beunpopular in our day if a young man imagines that be is one of natures misfortunes that

presses the soil in the bottom of the furrow as to prevent moisture from working either in or out of the soil the secretary is a combination of the disk and the subsoil plow the earth is turned by a disk about 27 inches in diameter and this is held down to work by a second narrow share two inches wide which works in the bottom of the furrow and is adjustable to various depths the farrow is about the same in width and it appears to do exce1lent work seeding is about a third done the season to date is at least two weeks earlier than it was in 1895 the snowfall in the mountains the past winter was much greater than the previous year and insures a good head of water for irrigation clover fields have wintered well alfalfa has killed out some how much cannot yet be determined this however should discourage no one from sowing alfalfa sown by itself in gool season in carefully prepared land and irrigated properly a good crop of hay can be cut the first year and even should it then winter kill it will be found upon plowing up the land and seeding it to a grain crop that the yield of grain will be enough better to warrant the expense and trouble of seeding to alfalfa farrowing season

fingers and looked rather pale and wondered whether the cap or the dynamite did the blasting in mining operations the young ladies of the physiology class last term introduced some rice kernels into the brain of an animal which was a subject for the dissecting room they expected to make an unsuspecting student think that the animal had some disease of the brain but their pretended innocence gave

taste of some of the experiences common to this worksome pleasant some erwise it is not all of life to be an editor to those who will take our place in this work next year we greet you with a handshake of congratulation and sympathy we hope at least that we have made a start 111 the right direction and that we may see the exponent carried on from this improving and growing till it will force its recognition upon all who may enjoy the benefits of a state institution such as the college of agriculture and mechanic arts we believe the exponent has done excellent work already as a means of  advertising college and keeping outsiders informed as to its progress and future hopes so to those who will follow dont get discouraged if the way does seem dark at times remember the work is not lost and dont let it be said the exponent died with the class of 189 we wish to thank the highly teemed president of our college for the encouragement he ha3 given us to the professors we greatly ciate your long suffering in our class work when lessons h ve been laid aside for exponent wor  and some2 college exponent times when not exponent work to the students of the college we can say you have given help with exceptionally good grace whenever asked especially we wish to thank those who have helped to mail the exponent the business men of bozeman have received the exponent very kindly and to those who have not been backward in advancing the work by liberally advertising we wish to thank you and will say to the dents that we shall try and return the favors whenever possible and to all who read the exponent we wish to thank you for the encour  agement we have received by you leaving the impression with us that the college exponent has been a success so far in its history and growth prof wm cobleigh of the chemical department of the college is ing to spend a pleasant summer tion he will leave bozeman for harvard cambridge mass about the first of july here he will take a six weeks summer course in vanced physics from there he will go to buffalo n y where he expects to meet dr f w traphagen of the college here they will together attend the meeting of the tion for the advancement of science from buffalo they will go to ington to attend the meeting of the association of official agricultural chemists they also expect to visit new york city here they will go through the principal colleges and institutions of learning especially columbia college where dr hagen completed his college work there the doctor will find many warm friends among the professors and what remaining schoolmates he may meet it is their purpose to visit many of the agricultural colleges of the east and other colleges of staing this certainly should be a very delightful and instructive trip and  we wish them success and an ble vacation field day is near at hand and the contestants are straining every nerve for the occasion bicyclists may be seen at all hours of the day on the

with the est hown by all the members we may hope to see a very strong organization in the future wishing to give a summary of the work and progress of the college during the past year i can do no ter than give the semiannual report of president james reid to the state board of education which appeared in the helena independent june 2d the board approved the action of the local executive board of the agricultural college in substituting in the curriculum the course of mechanicalengineering and istry for that of mining engineering and in adding the of domestic science and biology the employment of the local board of thomas a williams for the department of biology frank beach for the department of agriculture irrigation and engineering w h williams for the departmert of mechanical engineering and ematics mrs eliza owens domestic science and miss m a cantwell principal of the preparatory department was approved according to the estimates of the local executive board the receipts of the college for the fiscal year of 18967 will be about 38500 and the expenditures about 37700 the semiannual report of james reid president of the college showed that the institution has been progressing steadily the report which was adopted was as follows gentlemen i have the honor to submit herewith my semi annual report concerning the college and its work the work done in the classes has been on the whole very satisfactory the earnestness of the dents and the diligence shown by them have been above that shown in previous years the attendance upon classes has been more regular and a smaller proportion of the students have left during the year than formerly one of the chief difficulties in school and college work is to impress upon students the importance of making a regular standing from year to year alild avoiding conditions as far as possible this will develop and in fact the growth of this 4 college exponent idea during the past year has been qt1ite encouraging the number of students enrolled during the year bas been 129 in the various emic courses of these six are enrolled in  the ladies course three in the agricultural course five in stenography and typewriting twentytwo in the commercial course and sixtyone in the preparatory course there are in twentyfive enrolled as specials in music and one iu art making a total of 155 twelve counties are sented in the enrollment this year as against five last year and two from othei states the character of the work in the atory department has greatly improved and we feel that the change made in the tion of a more liberal training for our students has been a step in the right direction the faculty bas seen fit to ommend an additional year of preparatory work thus making the preparatory course three years in length which will put it on a level with the ordinary course in our high schools we have no doubt that the meagre and totally unsatisfactory training required for entrance to the higher courses in many of our colleges of agriculture and mechanic arts has done much to bring them into repute the object gained by a threeyear preparatory course which we would phasize is that we can give a liberal course in elementary science aud jn english and this we have kept in view throughout its development this will give the student who cannot afford the time and expense required for a college course the ity to obtain a sufficient knowledge of english for the ordinary work of life and such an acquaintance with the sciences as  may develop within him the faculty of obsvation and bring him more closely into tonch with nature rrhe aim has been also to give the preparatory student some of the benefits arising from manual training for purpose we give two terms of drawing in the third year in addition to which he has tbe laboratory work in connection w
ith the sciences we have also made some changes in the college courses giving a two years course in domestic sdence a two years course in agriculture and a fouryear course in general science  students whc have taken the required amount of preparatory work and who haili completed the course in domestic science or agriculture may regularly enter the third year of the general science course and grad uate from that course in two years from the time he enters it lhere has also been added a course in mechanical engineering and a course in chemistry each covering a period of four years the work of all the classes has gone forward without any ruption throughout the year of a serious nature the conduct of the students has been all that could be desired and three suspensions which occurred during the year were in two cases on account of incapacity and careless work and the third for the transgression of a rule the student being readmitted after a few days the moral tone of the students throughout has been very gratifying and is deserving of commedation the cost of books and magazines etc adjed to the library during the year is sl06572 the number of volumes added bas been 483 miss jennie jones bas had charge of the library for the greater part of tbe year and has been both diligent and efficient in her duties her services should be recognized in such a manner as you may think proper interest by lucy stafford the keynote of interest is knowledge it is impossible for anyone to be interested in a subject they knoy nothing about interest velops with study how often we see people who live within a narrow circle and have no interest outside of college exponent 5 1cumference of this circle they the c1  d not care 1f all the rest of the  lc1 were blotted out of ex1stence y01   so long as their petty universe was left intact   the greater the number of yc have in the world the greater w11l 1 our enjoyment for we all know 1e  11  b how greatly we enjoy ta nng a out or hearing about anything vye are much interested in the great ialist loves to talk about his special ubject but often his whole interest is concentrated on this subject he is unable to talk about anything else and is very much bored if anyone talks on a different subject the people who are styled cranks and who are considered so ble are those people who have chosen to devote their time and talents to omething that is not of interest to the general public many students say i am not going to study that science i am not interested in it how do they pect to be interested in it if they do not study it and learn of the ing features it presents we have heard students say they wpre not interested in botany when they did not know the difference between a buttercup and bluebell it is characteristic of stud en ts as a class to judge hastily thev hear a few things about anything they dont like these few things and they immediately conclude that they do not like them as a whok the true scientist is very slow about forming opinions and he usually only holds those that he does form tentatively to be let go if necessary as other facts develop this should be the attitude of the student when oinning a study he should determine to learn all he can about it and the interest yi1l develop as he learns to study anything which claims our interest is not a burden but a ure the more we know about a subject the less difficu1t will it be to study it why he wept 0 why are yon weeping lhtle prep why are you weeping so sad slow was his answer and slow his step he said ah me but i feel sad cause the senior class graduated today and i shant see them nary again with a choke for all of ems going so far far away far far away and im just dead broke   poor little prep   i sadly said we must all of us part with the ones we love but perhaps you will meet them again some time in the world below or the world above but he only wept and sadly replied i shant want no peanuts after lm dead but i want some nowthis minutei rfo  n that senior class borrowed my last five cent and they baint paid it back n all of ms went and i cant buy no peanutsboohooboo   6 college exponent abstracts of theseso of the graduating class the four following articles are tended to give an idea as to how the subjects for the theses of the senior class were treated anyone can ize the difficulty of trying to cover the ground of a thesis of two thousand or more words in an abstract of one to two hundred words or even to convey the central thought of the production the cyanide process for t
reating gold and silver ores by w t shaw that potassium cyanide in solution with water dissolves gold and silver has been known since the beginning of this century but not till recent years lid a practical and economic process come into use now we have a process known as the cyanide process  in use in every part of the world and the prospects of this process has every feature of great opment and practical application in the near future in writing a thesis on this subject a short history of the development of the process is given along with its usefulness and general good to the world comprising the scope and workings of its methods the istry of the process is quite cated in its details and so a great deal of this would be of interest or benefit to but a few an important part of the work of this thesis is the result and conclusions drawn from extensive tory work both in the extraction of the precious metals and in their recovery from the potassium cyanide various kinds of ores also tailmgs from stamp mills were treated with different strengths of solution of potassium cyanide u
nder varying conditions as to time and manner of treatment etc etc both agitation and percolation were tried on different ores in recovering the metals from the solution electricity was tried in various ways cipitating on carbon on zinc etc    was experimented with various ther were some gmg satisfaction others not careful notes and elucidation of all this work comprises an important part of the thesis then the practical application of the process is set forth the dangers f failure to the practical metal1urg1st the of success the good features of different rums now in operation etc especially are the ods of success and failure of the gilt edge mining and milling company and the iron rod dwelt on and resons for their success and failure given the central thought througout the whole thesis is to set forth and develop the practical application of the process to different ores theories have not been indulged in and the conclusions reached are not what some other person has said or done but are the results of experience reached by thorough experiments in  the laboratory or by actual observtions from mills which have been successfuuy run college exponent 7 the short story in rlooern fiction by florence jennette foster the character of a nation is largely the outgrowth of its literature books magazines and newspapers  ndex the thought of the age and are l  f a powerful influence on the actions o its people scotts historical novels picture clearly customs and caracteristics of their time the sp1nt of the crusades is in them and still arouses the reader to ambitious thoughts of knightly daring in ament or battle in an age to come the character sketches of hamlin garland james whitcomb riley and a score of oters will give a truer idea of the nineteenth century individually than can be gained from any history literature may be divided into two great classes truth and fiction the former em bracing all historical and scientific matter the latter under it all forms of the poem and the novel of these poetry is the more resthetical its aim is as poe says the creation of beauty the manifestation of the real by the ideal in words that move in metrical array all prose must keep within the bounds of logic this is true of the novel as well as the t
heological discourse it detracts fron1 its beauty of expression and sublimity of action but does not hinder its usefulness it has a

mportant hranch although its beginning was in land its fullest development has been in america and here washington ing was the founder the tendency of our literature is toward the short story it occupies a place supplementary to the novel its brevity prevents any elaborate plot and force is gained by ness often it is a reproduction of some occurrence in the authors life a bit o

definite idea but as geology is essentially a p
ractical science this subject if we stop to think of it has an est for the general public geologists divide the time which is chronicled by g
eologic strata into periods now between the rock tems which mark the first two ods of time there is great uncon formity that is t
he strata cannot be traced continuously from one to the othe1 but thete is a v
ery distinct 8 college exponent line of separation in the first rock system the rocks are made up largely of materials which have been fused and much changed by heat there are no absolute evidences that life existed at that time the second series of strata is composed of very different rocks rnd in these rocks are found abundant evidences that plant and animal life existed at that time many fossils are found representatiyes of all the types of animals that now exist except vertebrates are found it was during the time which intervened between these two formations that our present types of animals made their appearance and this is the reason the geologic val is of so much importance the information on this subject is at the present time mostly lative but it is to be hoped that future discoveries will throw more light on this subject money by 0 p  morgan in taking up the money question the first thing considered is its origin and history money originated from a demand of commerce for something to act as a medium of exchange it is the function of money to serve as the medium of exchange at different times in history we find different metals used as money but above all others gold and silver have had the widest circulation gold and silver had for almost three centuries previous to the monetization of silver in 1873 held an almost equal ratio but when silver was demonetized the value of gold in terms of silver became greatly enhanced this of course shows the power of congress to establish a legal parity between the two metals since it is the province of money to serve commerce to be a medium of exchange it is not necessary that it be a good standard of deferred ments 1he value of money in relation to produce is all the time changing so in order that we may have a good standard of deferred payments we must adopt the multiple standard the principle of this scheme is that a certain amount of a number of acles are taken to form the standard  the amount of rnoney it takes to purchase this bill at a given time wlll be the unit of value the last thing considered is paper money the money that has no trinsic value the validity of paper money is tested through the discsion of seignoirage we find in europe where through debasement of the coin copper has been substuted for gold it is not debasement that causes depreciation in the it is excessive issues arbor day it is rather late to chronicle the events of arbor day but our paper being published monthly during the school year we are compelled to make note of events which took place some time in the past and are of little importance as news at present arbor day as set apart by the governor comes but once a year and owing to the fact that it was the first time that the day was observed by any of the classes of the montana college of agriculture we feel that it is quite necessary to give an account of the proceedings iri company with president reid and a few friends the senior and junior classes went out to the place reserved for the college campus the college exponent 9 company was vyelcomed at the experiment station by professor emery and wife the ladies of the two classes understood that trees ould not be successfully set out something to fill in the dirt around them so they procured els and throwing them across their boulders moved on to the site ed for the trees it was amusing to notice how well disciplined the ladies were in ina dirt they did r
emarkably well b as to handling quantity the only objection that could be made was that they threw about as much dirt behind them as they did around the trees ve can probably a
ccount for the soil being promiscuously strewn nbont as there chanced to be a wind that afternoon wm t shaw being ill there were only three members of the senior class present so the labor of shoveling some of the productive soil of the station over the roots of the balm of gilead trees rested principally upon the ladies of the class misses foster and stafford from the ease with which they handled the shovels it appeared that they were not in need of the other member  of the class in respect to help the students thought that their trees might grow until some day in the future the violent winds perhaps would break them loose from their foundation causing their equilibrium to be overbalanced thence they would mark their length on the ward side of the spot where they now stand so ffiform the people of those days who it was that set out those trees a short history of the senior class and a few verses for the juniors were written and burierl neath them the seniors buried all of their puns remembrances of the trials and ulations experienced on examination days all differences e
xisting among the members of the clcss and many other matters too numerous to mention so at present they are prepared to face the battles of life with a clear conscience and a willing hand the junior class consisting of edna robinson clara foster and ed blankenship have one more year of mental taxation to experience before its members can take up the practical part of life it is hoped that the iors may be permitted to assemble upon the college campu on arbor 
day in 1897 and set out another gilead tree and that tb y will not have any past differences to bury beneath it thereby checking its growth but that they will have n abundance of puns and other happy experiences of the best side of school life to ish the balm of gilead through its period of development after the classes had finished their work refreshments were served at the home of professor emery while the guests were enjoying selves the appointed thne to meet the street car passed by so a pleasant afternoon walk was enjoyed on the way from the station to town art department the work done in the art department during the past school year has been entirely satisfactory students parents and teacher are well satisfied with the results of the year mrs marshall gives a three years in art instruction and is ous to have her students enter with the intention of staying the full course but many only wish to spend a year and so the course must be modified to a certain degree in order 10 college exponent to give the students the greatest amount of useful knowledge and practice possible in so short a time any one wishing to know thing of the amount of work done and its character should visit the art exhibit given by the instructor at the art room it is a fine display of work for students in the first year of their course those who cannot visit the department would receive an cellent idea of the progress and work of the students by reading an article in the avant courier of may 23 on this subject a great many people have the idea that an art education is only for an accomplishment for young ladies now this is very wrong one might safely say that no gentlemans tion is complete in any sense till he has at least a good w0rking edge of free hand drawing and for a technical education of almost any kind such a knoledge is almost indispensible one having work around mines with geological tions with mill work or in fact thing in this line will never regret the time spent on free hand drawing besides in architectural work of any kind one must be proficient in this work then mechanical engineering surveying civil engineering and all professions in this line will be greatly strengthened and the work facilitated by a good know ledge of free hand drawing along with some other phases of art work besides its thoroughly practical application we must look to the study of art in its several jines for a most excellent means of developing of the most useful faculties of the mind the principal among these is the observing powers next is the faculty of comparison then form color etc a neglect of a proper development of the observing powers is a most serious mistake in the cation of a great many students president james reid went to na saturday and

in the april exponent an erro1 was made by the editor in ing upon the secretary p1ow this plow named after secretary morton commissioner of the department of agriculture is devised to obviate the error of construction in the common turning plow which operates upon the wedge system and in exerting sufficient pressure to turn over the furrow slice so thoroughly carnpacts the bottom of the furrow as to vent moisture from penetrating into the soil below the depth of the row and in times of drought is almost as much of a bar to moisture arising from the soil to the surface of the earth the secretary plow is a combination of a subsoil and a disk the former being two inches in diam12 college exponent eter while the disk is twentyseven inches in diameter and is adjustable to different depths the disk is set at an angle to the general course of the subsoiler and in operating the plow the subsoil is not brought to the face of the soil the disk throws the earth sufficient to cover stubble but does not invert the furrow as does the turn plow the draft is somewhat greater than a sulky plow but it does much better work it is ing a great problem to the man who irrigates to so plow his land that it will absorb sufficient water on the first irrigation when water is usually in good supply to make the crop doubtedly this can be done under a proper system of subsoiling and it is all essential that this plowing be done economically and scientifically more land is under experiment test this season than the past oats wheat barley flax peas sugar beets mangel wurtzels carrots broom

edsall 97 business    asst business manager subscription fifty cents per annum in advance to our patrons there are many subscribers to the exponent who are ofthe opinion that the paper was to be published monthly during the entire year it is to be published only once a month during the school year the college exponent should issue monthly during the school year accordingly the first issue should make the impression upon its ers that the editors had had a rest during vacation and were able to put forth a splendid copy on the contrary our editors have been gaged in various kinds of work since last june and consequently find some difficulty in writing editorials and preparing other such matter as is necessary to make up a college paper therefore they hope not to be cised too severely in their effort to place the college news before the people many of the editors and assistants who were elected to positions on the exponent staff last spring are not in college this year therefore the first issue of the exponent has been layed in order to select members to fill the vacancies one year ago there were many dents who were looking forward with much anticipation to the completion of the new college buildings it was the opinion that the students of the ent school year would enjoy the first use of the magnificent structures but this year draws upon us finding the same routine of work going on at the 2 college exponent high school building and the old academy information was lately received that the chemical building would not be finished until next ber we hoped especially that the chemical laboratory would be ready for use before the close of the winter term because of the difficulties perienced in obtaining good results from our work in our present ters we feel very grateful to the business men of bozeman for the interest shown by advertising in this issue of the exponent the publication of this paper has been placed in the hands of the students but there are no funds given them therefore this periodical must depend upon its own resources for its existence there are several business men of the city who have refused to give us an ment or lend aid in any manner we trust that when the circumstances are fully understood the existence of the agricultural college in our midst will be well enough appreciated for the business men to give us a share of their advertising our rates were thought to be too high last year so we have reduced them and at present our prices are as reasonable as those in any advertising medium in tana the exponent has a tion of 2500 copies which are sent to the taxpayers of gallatin valley and other parts of the state the students have organized an athletic association for the purpose of receiving the necessary amount of exercise while attending school they have been engaged in playing ball since school commenced and when the weather becomes bad they will be likely to start a gymnasium about fortytwo of the college boys took part in the parade on the day that the cornerstone was laid they marched under the direction of cap tain cobleigh while playing football one evening after school harry patterson and thomas caldwell thought that they would play a trick on the boys ing distant a few yrrds they paced toward each other with equal veity a collision occurred and on their heads which were somewhat most the points of contact were distinctly marked as soon as they discovered that they received the most effective part of the joke a mutual agreement was soon made not to try it again during the game professor wilcox has his classes so arranged that he has one day off during the week this gives him a chance to gather material for the laboratory work in zoology sales and caldwell are making great progress in they found the distance from the corner of the experiment station building to the top of old baldy mountain to be a fraction oyer eight miles  the ference in level was somewhat over 3000

beets on a more ra1s1 o tensive scale the college camera club took a trip up rocky canyon on the 18th ult for the purpose of securing some snap shots at some of the most tiful scenery in montana it bemg a cloudless day lhere were many good impressions procured the pleasure of this trip completely overshadowed the disagreeableness of the preceding picnic which will be well bered by the members of the club who came in contact with a heavy rainstorm work on the new buildings is being rapidly pushed by the contractors and if favorable weather continues a few weeks longer the walls will be up leaving only the roofs and the inside work which can easily be ried on during the winter all male students of the college who are in good standing may become members the initiation fee is 50 cents and monthly due for incidental expenses is 10 cents fines are to be imposed upon members for nonformance of duty the present members realize the benefit derived from a literary ing and are going in with a

from the analyses of sugar beets now being conducted by dr traphagen one has shown a sugar content of nineteen and ten ths 192 per cent of sugar in round numbers this means that a ton of such beets would yield 384 pounds of sugar worth here at the present time about s2200 there should be a margin between this and the cost of production freights labor etc to make the sugar business a very profitable oce for the gallatin county farmer the young orchard has made exceptionally fine growth during the season and the wood is ripening up in good order the stems of the trees are now being wrapped with npapers to give them protection both from the ravages of rabbits and field mice and from severe cold to which the montana tree is so liable eleven hundred heads of celery have been trenched in the open ground for winter trenches were dug the width of a spade and sufficiently deep to permit the celery to be picked therein upright the tops being level with the surface of the ground as it grows colder this will be covered so as to protect it from freezing although freezing will not materially injure if it is well protected from the air plowing for planting is now being vigorously prosecuted preparatory department the course has been extended to three years which will place it on a level with the courses in our accredited high schools meagre and poor preparatory training for professional courses has borne a sufficiently bountiful harvest of inefficient professional work the course as extended provides not only a thorough drill in the common branches but in addition eleruentary work in the natural sciences and an option in latin for those who wish to do more thorough language work this course will give the student who can not afford the time and expense required for a college course the opportunity to obtain a sufficient knowledge of english for the nary work of life and such an acquaintance with the sciences as may develop within him the faculty of observation and bring him into closer touch with nature the desire is also to give the preparatory student some knowledge of manual training for this purpose we give two terms of drawing in the third year in addition to which the sdent has the laboratory work in ccnnection with bis study of the sciences a liberal course of reading is given for each year of the preparatory work and sdents are requested tu cover the course as far as possible it is also desired they purchase the works named thus making them a part of their own library preparatory course first year fall term grammar 4

students who intend to take the ical engineering course shuuld take drawing the hunters camp the scene of the following poem was on the clear water river in idaho about three miles from where the carlin party deserted their cook colgate during the winter of 1893 colgate was an aged man he was taken sick and conld not travel in the midst of a snow storm the party packed up their equipments and deerted their camp for fear of becoming snowbound the old gentleman was left alone in the desolate mountains to endure untold hardships the hunters camp back in those grim old mountains with their lofty peaks so white a sight i see that comes to methe hunters camp by night and the snow ifts through the branches that the bleak winds gently sway as the hunters smoke and laugh and joke telling their tales of the day and one tells how the fourpoint buck escaped him thro a trick i shot too highwith a little if he hadnt been so quick and the glare of the firlog fire lights the scene for many a yard and the night winds groan and sob and moan and now its snowing hard when i lived in montana oh youve told us that before and so they chaff and oftimes laugh vhile the blaze grows more and more a shout look out your coats afire a jump and cries of mirth but a little snow lays that fire low almost before its birth now set the coffee on the firesomething warm and then to bed and the thing is done by tbe nearest one about as soon as said then one of the lads starts singing in a noble baritone and the rest join in and theyre all akin for the song is home sweet home down in the stormswept gulches where the elks are wont to roam the old song flies and echo replies sweet home sweet home sweet home rhen silencewoo knows sadnessthoughts they think but do not tell then a mournful cry wakes earth and skyonly a cougars yell but the night is fast advancing and its time to go to bed so to the tent its sides snowbent they go and the fire is dead and silence reigns with darkness save for a little spark whose brightness holds in the bed of coals and a coyotes weird bark december 1894 0 m b 6 college exponent fertility of the soil the task of fertilizing the soil is one that the farmers of the productive west are not compelled to perform but the question arises will the soil always be as productive as it has been in the past it is a thought that rarely occurs to the farmer though it deserves more attention than it has received the first tillers of the soi enjoy the benefit of the fertilizing properties which have been forming since the rocks first began t0 grate into dust but unless precaution is used the cultivated districts here will become exhausted as they have in other parts of the world where the farming industry has been carried on extensively while the return for labor is sufficient the farmer seldom questions himself about the source of his bounteous yields according to chemistry something cannot be made out of nothing then the source of farm products must be tablegrowing properties stored away in the soiland to use these substances such as potassium phosphoric acid and lime the supply must diminish there is a constant waste of growing material when crops are harvested the products being shipped to foreign markets a great amount of the fertility could easily be returned to the soil if the straw could be advantageously kept until it becomes decayed it is a common thingforthe farmers to burn their straw a practice which should not be carried on too sively without making some gation as to its advisability the farmer seldom thinks of the injury to his farm when he hauls sixty or seventyfive bushels of grain per acre to market1 and then applies a match to the straw of his last years crop yet it is true that the principal ingredients of vegetable life are fast disappearing from the land the disintegration of rock and the fertilizing process of distributing stone over the soil by irrigation are not sufficient to replace the loss of such immense quantities of fertilizing materials as  those sent to foreign markets and those which disappear in flame it is advisable for the farmer to make good use of the straw left over from his winters feeding old straw stacks are very much in the w
ay at times but when stored on the poorest part of the ta rm and left to decay they will at some future time give a twofold return for the trouble that they caused the farmer if he will only redistribute the remaining fertilizing material if the people of this age strive too greedily for their gains and unsarily destroy the fertility of the soil their posterity must suffer t
he consequences i in the future the tillers of the soil will lle compelled to use fertilizing mai erial at a great expense or else be contented with a yield for a 
great amount oflabor the authorities of the princeton university have issued a pamphlet showing the cost of an education at that place the pamphlet shows that out of fiftyfour honormen in recent classes nearly threefourths spent only 500 or less annually and nearly onehalf 400 a year or less miss marion weldon of lewistown mont is visiting her brother mr downing who is attending college miss

realizing the portance of celebrating in full on this rare occasion remained until the program was rendered as arranged had the architects and builders of tiquity had the courage presence of mindand determination thus to brave the storms and place their manuscripts and coins under their structures probably the present age would be better informed about 8ncient arts but little did they think of the value that such things would be to the people of the present time our guage and the stamp upon the silver dollar may not be a curiosity to the people a few generations hence but probably will be

males and one fem ale were found in this county we have a slight evidence of change about us today in 1873 there were 50 male and 59 female teachers in 1882 there were 64 male and 127 female and in 1895 we had 203 male and 675 female teachers our first report that of 1868 shows there were 1359 children of school age here while our last gives nearly 40000 the ammmt paid to teachers in 1868 was about 8000 while today it is fifty times as much aggregating close on to 400000 the campfire school and the log school house have given way in one instance at least to an elegant strture costing nearly 150000 our educational advantages are day taking a front rank in the ward march and we are not ashamed of the results our state university has been opened we are buildtng a state normal at

citizen is always interested in the maintenance and improvement of the public school tem because it lies at the foundation of our national existence we fully realize that the active duties of private and public life are better performed by intelligent and cultivated men and women in the west says bayard lor all the traits of our national character are intensifiedits energy its its ambition and its sensitiveness we are proud of our schools we are college exponent 11 proud of our teachers we are proud of our state and we are proud of our fell 0 w citizens our ideals either in our school law or in our schools may never be ized but we have endeavored to keep abreast of the varying requirements of the hour we have raised the standard of requirements of our teachers but nowhere do we reach our highest expectations we have tried to strengthen the intellect but we have yet to quicken the conscience while there is yet a great work to be performed we believe with mr dougherty that the free public school has met all reasonable expectations it has given us increased power in the production of wealth it has diminished pauperism by ing new avenues of labor and by showing how money can be saved as well as earned it has made more of social life and there is less crime to be supported or punished it has opened nobler fields of ambition than fields of war for it has cherished human brotherhood it has furnished a skilled force at hand for constant wants and energiesa force that has opened our mines established our workshops and made the waste places blossom as the rose it has caused the children of the saxon the norman the celt and the teuton to become true americans yes it does fulfill all reasonable expectations let us show our thorough belief in it by striving to perpetuate and prove it mr chairman the teachings of this institution will be carefully auarded b  and we trust the results will be found in the highest types of manhood and womanhood in those who go forth from this college into the marts of trade may the flag of this glorious union ever float over the aspirations the inspirations and the ennobling thoughts engendered here may the love of god and the love of country find an abiding place in the hearts of the youth of this great state and especially those who are fortunate enough to find wisdom within these walls then sir we can rest sured that

mathematical rule that when any number of forces act in the same direction their ant will be the sum of all the ponent forces and will act in the direction of the components but if the forces act in different directions   the resultant will be less than the sum of the components and act in a direction somewhere intermediate tween that of the components man always has this problem before him he has a certain amount of energy which he can expend either as one concentrated force or in a numbe1 of components the mind is but the medium of transform a ti on of the forces of the body in the same manner that the dynamo is the means of transforming the power of the steam engine now it is manifest that if there are a dozen great motors to be run by dynamos and each requires the power of a thousand dynamos the engineer vould connect a thousand dynamos with each motor instead of dividing the energy of each of the twelve sand dynamos among the twelve motors in this world there are hundreds of fields to be worked and each requires the undivided energy of thousands of minds now it seems to be a verv simple and vvise thing that the entie energy of each mind should be applied to some special field of work each of these fields is a large one and no man no matter how much he centrates his energy can hope fully to master any one of these divisions much less if he divides his between a dozen or more every opportunity of life every fielj of ence is boundless thousands of men can put their undivided atttion upon one department for generations and the field for investigation and progress still remains infinitely large the engineer of today has before him bright prospects but if he desires to make a mark in the world he very wiselv makes a specialty of one of the various subdivisions of engineering the electrical egineer who the present day has a very brilliant field before him must yet divide his field and velop along some special line if he desires to become eminent the chemist has a field which is pratically without limit and to gain distinction must necessarily choose a special branch the lawyer no longer attempts to cover the whole field but also makes a specialty of some department and so it is in all of the various professions but when a man desires to make a ipecialty of some department it is well that he should first acquire such a general education as is consistent with the circumstances if it is not necessary that he shall enter upon his life work as soon as he possibly can it is desirable that he should acquire a general education but in many cases it is different the person has barely time secure the necessary education and training connected with his department it would be unwise in such a case for him to try to obtain a general education in preference to a special traiing when he goes out into the world he will find that his general education is of no immediate benefit to him unless he has sufficiently tered the work of some special department college exponent 13 the new department topics prom other colleges of domestic science and arts a department of domestic science and rt has been organized during the present year mrs eliza owens who organized the department in the state college in iowa and has had charge of the work there for eight years bas been placed in charge the iowa state register in speaking of the

all but the young man or the young woman who has the courage to take up school work can surely muster enough courage to make arrangements to commence college at the beginning of the school year intercollegiate contests in athletics are not as frequent in the west in portion to the number of colleges as they are in the east owing partly to the fact that the colleges are situated many miles apart and the railroad fares are so exorbitant one year ago last spring our college base ball team managed to meet the livingston team a few times victories were about evenly divided and it appears that each team thought it a good policy to leave well enough alone for last season there were very few efforts to secure another game it is not as much pleasure for students to engage in debate or athletic contests with the city or county clubs as with other students therefore intercollegiate contests should be encouraged cording to the delaware college view the university of indiana izing the importance of athletic tests bears all expenses incurred by its athletic ssaociation this appears to be a large undertaking for an tution but colleges can often afford to bear the expenses of their athletic associations when the students not there are in the west many students who cannot afford to spend very much money in order to age intercollegiate contests in debate and athletics when they overcome the financial difficulties which arise to prevent them from continuing their course at college they feel that it would be useless to think of spending money for other purposes it is nestly hoped that our college officials and the students will soon cooperate in a movement to encourage contests with other colleges and even with other teams of the adjacent cities and toins there was considerable talk about arranging a game of foot ball between the college team and a picked team of explayers from the city of bozeman the game was to be played on thanksgiving but the day went by without anyone witnessing that portant event which would have been the first foot ball game that ever took place in the city as there vvere many anxious people waiting to see that great game which did not take place we feel that it would be some satistion to them if we make a prophecy as to how it would have been carried on the majority of the explayers of the city are 200pound professional ness men and a few of the city ployes it would have been a sight worth seeing to witness the heavweights of our professional ranks and police force taking their respective sitions as quarterback rightand tackle centerrush etc and then watching patiently for the ball to be put in play in order for them to make an exhibit of their present activity and past experience we can imagine how hard these heavyweights would have hit the ground whenever there chanced to be a fall thereon and what a waste of energy whenever they attempted to kick the ball through a goal missing it completely if the city team expects to play the college eleven they had better practice how io fall easy also how to kick a foot ball unless they intend to use one as large as a whisky barrel we further suggest that they college exponent 3 d better be careful and not select ha most able men from the 1 nks and police force of the ona ra f d 1  b ause there will be need o me c1tv ec     d during the game a co1 oner to

t that the foot ball enthusiasm tr us  tincr among the players of the proex1s o h d clty team will not cease to sue pose  a aree that it cannot be rekmdled a eo ome time in the near future the literary style and even the matical construction in most college japers are not as presentable as they l t would be had students taken more 1me to rearrange their material for cation the masterpieces in literature are those which gave their authore many hours of hard study possibly thev were copied and retouched many before they were allowed to be published the famous authors were those  who had a natural ability to vrite and were not disturbed by matters foreign to their composition work writers cannot present their work in an acceptable manner less they have something to say and know how to say it the student who lays aside for a few ments the subjects of astronomy biology logic and geology in order to write editorials locals etc should be expected to do work that would pare favorably in form at least with that done by the newspaper man of average equipment carefully read the advertisements in the exponent so that you may learn who are the most liberal men in the city totradewith education the obtaining of an education at the present day is a task of a life time  the subjects to be mastered in a ough education are so many and so extensive that no mind of any capacity can ever learn and retain all that is to be learned the student of the present era must study in subjects far above those quired in a college training only fifty years ago if he hopes to cope with educated men of his own day a few years after the student gives up the study of geography spelling and arithmetic he has forgotten the most important points some school boy of the sixth or eighth grade may solve a problem which he could not or tell of some seaport that he could notcall to mind the separate branches of study have been broarlened to such a degree that there are very few professional men who become thorough in them some of our foremost lawyers cannot form you immediately  when tioned in regard to certain points in law though if you will give them a few moments to refer to their library they can give you the information sought when subjects become so broad that men cannot master them then men can only serve as an index to knowledge the ordinary child ten years old at the present time kuows more about a great many sciences than did tes plato or aristotle socrates was the most learned man of his day though he found out only enough to know and make the assertion i know tnything  4 college exponent reason peter sieh though at first thought it may seem that a discussion of the subject of this article is not interesting upon a little further consideration it will be seen that no subject is so interesting and vital to the human race it is the faculty of reasoning that has made man what he is today man is tinguished from all other animals in the fact that he is a reasonable ure why then should not the cussion of reason be of interest to the public it is the only thing which distinguishes  man from the other members of the animal kingdom if man does not make use of the power he lowers himself to the level of the dumb brute now every man possesses the oning power and uses it to some tent but it is surprising how this power is neglected by a great number of people reason should govern every action and thought of man but such is far from being the case the great mass of people will gladly accept without further consideration any law or theory laid down by persons in whom they are accustomed to have faith this trait of human character must always be a great barrier to the general progress and welfare of the civilized world in earlier times this faculty was much neglected especially in its cation to the naturalsciences tion kept the mental powers in jection and w heuever anyone would venture to suggest some theory other than the generally accepted ones be was ridiculed and persecuted agoras a greek philosopher who said reason rules the world was sent into exile in exile he very fully said it is uqt i whq have lost the athenians but the athenians who have lost me socrates that great thinker of early days and whose favorite maxim was knov thvself was condemned to death by thepeole whose paths he lighted galileo of a later age was sent into exile we should be thankful that those conditions exist no more still there are clouds hovering over perfect free dom yet the philosophers of todav and their work are the product of fre thought without freedom of reasoning and the exercise thereof the stock of knowledge would have been very meagre compared with what it is darwin huxley agassiz tyndall and a host of others are all examples of unhampered reason reason should be not only the tool of the naturalist and philosopher but should govern every action of our daily life whenever any question arises in the mind we should ask ourselves the question is it consistent with reason if it does not stand the test of reason it should be discarded if this method were eployed and not so much b1ind advance indulged in many mistakes would be avoided there is a reason for everything or it would not be let everyone use this grecit faculty as his guide in his life work let each do his share towards the general lightenment of the world to make man capable of his great errand upon this earthto rule or at least to prehend all things thereon the faculty surprised the students by announcing that a resolution had been passed compelling all students to take part in some kind of literary work any student who refuses to take part in this kind of work will be summoned to appear and give reasons for nonperformance of duty college exponent 5 lack of motive said the mother of miss willard makes life dreary but lack of motive we rnay add that nothing makes life a failure but lack of m0tive even if we should fail indeed of doing anything in itself of lasting wortb yet tbe discipline of the effort to ize a high ideal will redeem a life from ure we need to be reminded over and over again that it is not alone nor chiefly what we do but what we become that marks the  uccess of life but with a definite and high motive power in our lives we shall almost certainly ceed in every view of the case we may not succeed as our fond dreams of youth would have it they are very sweet and doubtless serve a good purpose but it should be the part of tbe resolute will to hold these well under control not to crush them with rude ullsympathetic hand to retain their iasm but to turn it to more practical count we may not succeed as our little over partial community imagines that its hero must succeed dickens tells us of what great expectations were cherished of the boy who stood first in bis school what a tir he would make in the great world what a name he would win but the great world moved on just the same after he entered it as before ard he

8enator morrill of mont introduced a lill for the endowment of colleges of agriculture and mechanic arts it was passed by congress and signed by president lincoln while the nation was in the throes of civil war this is now known as the first morrill bill it provides that 30000 acres of land in place of scrip shall be apportioned to each state for each tor and member of congress the proceeds trom the sale of which shall form a nant fund for the support and maintenance of colleges of agriculture and mechanic arts the object in view the enabling act gave 50000 acres the enabling act admitting montana to the union gives an additional s50000 acres for the establishment and maintenance of the college to be disposed of as the state legislature may see fit the legislature of 1895 authorized the issue of bonds to the amount of 10000 pledging as security the proceeds arising from the sale and lease of said land requiring that the money from t1e sale of bonds should be used for the erection and equipment of suitable buildings these buildings are now in course of construction and will bei completed ready for occupancy in 1897 none of these funds can be used for the erection of buildings or fur repairs improve ments fuel or furnishings but only for pament of salaries apparatus and equipment we are dependent upon the state for the former and the u s commissioner holds that having accepted the endowment prothe  act requires that the fund shall vided by the morrill bills a state also remain forever undimished and that the interest shall be appropriated to the men support and maintenance of a college whose leading object shall be without cluding other scientific and classical studies and including military tactics to teach such branches of learning as are related to culture and the mechanic arts in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several suits and professions of life the second morrill act the second morrill act provides that for the more complete endowmert and tenance of colleges for the benefit of culture and th8 mechanic arts there shall be annually appropriated the sum of 15000 for the year ending june 30 1890 and an annual increase thereafter for ten years by an additional sum of sl000 and the annual amount to be paid thereafter to e ch state and territory shall be s25000 thus each of these colleges will reci ve in 1899 from the second morrill act 825000 and a similar amount each succeeding year thereafter accepts the conditions and is in duty bound to provide suitable buildings and a sufficient yearly

system of marking at a recent meeting of the faculty the passing mark was lowered from 7010 to 6010 the marking by percentage has been abandoned as satisfactory and marking by letters has been

until june a weeks vacation at easter is granted in many schools and it has been thought of here so far it has not been customary and it is doubtful if it would be advantageous a term examination calls for an extra tion on the part of both the student and instructor the student should begin a terms work yith a fresh vigor but if no vacation is given tbis will not be the case at least in the majority of instances but if a weeks vacation were given it would necessitate the prolongation of the term in june and this would be a decided disadvantage again the effect of a vacation upon the student would not always be heneficial as a case of spring fever is likely to be cultivated so it is doubtful if it would help matters to have a tion mrs marshall has recently received a number of casts for the art ment the studio already contained some excellent casts which were quite up to date with last years work but of course some of the students are more advanced this year and sequently need more advanced casts the students began work on parts of the human features last year and among the new casts are several fine heads copies from the best antiques these are venus de milo sophocles medusa bodanini juno cudovici and augustus among the best of the casts are bu 3 of the apollo belvedere and clytie there are also several casts of vegetables fruits leaves and geometric figures for grouping and fine casts copied from barye bronzes a lion tiger wolf and bear and heads of a fox horse cat and other animals some of these new casts especially the beautifully modeled hands arms and feet of children are still a little beyond the power of ornary students but as mrs marshall says her students are all of them traordinary and they of course will be able to surmount even greater difficulties the equipment of the college has been enriched within the past few weeks by the addition of two sets of maps for use in latin and history the first set contains roman epire the world known to the cients ancient italy gaul to illtrate the gallic wars of greece and asia minor there is also for class drill an outline map of the countries bordering on the mediteranean these maps

ye are not so sure the mechanical difficulties of having a shelf placed hei ween the door and the transom are considerable and a bust placed on such a shelf would make it impossible to move the transom but suppose these conditions both fulfilled we must imagine a transom of rather magnificent proportions to allow the raven to be upon the bust of pallas with her large crested helmet as usually represented and to allow light from still higher to shine through and cast the ravens shadow upon the floor according to stanzas twelve thirteen and seventeen the author was sitting in a velvetcushioned seat elm wn up in front of and facing the 1oori or was just rising from it and if any shadow came from a light in the hall way it would have fallen hind him as he had a lamp in the room witness stanzas one seven etc and also had an open fire see stanza two the light in the hall must have been a very powerful one to cast a haclow on the floor but to bring our argument to an hibernian close the author didnt know whether it was light or dark in the hall until he opened the door and then he found as we do nov that there vas no lamp at all in the hall and that it was lutely

uestion while the fact is there has been and is still great difference of opinion upon the subject the history of education and educational reforms is very interesting the controversy has been carried on for centuries and the fate of educational methods and systems hang upon the result the best education it is pretty generally accepted that the training which best develops and disciplines all the faculties is the truest and best education this is no doubtthethought of herbert spencer when he defined education to be a preparation for complete living taigne said the end of education is wisdom and virtue comenius holds that it is knowledge virtue and ion john locke believed it to be health of body virtue and good ners herbart held that itconsisted in virtue and the realization of inner freedom kant and fichte that it sisted chiefly in the formation of acter these all agree in making phatic the development of the ethical and spiritual faculties and the tion of habits of right thinking and doing the mistakes in education one great of the past has been the development of the memory while ignoring the growth of the faculties of research and observation the new education appeals more to the reason and imagination and less to memory filling the mind with dry disjointed facts while failing to arouse any interest or enthusiasm is not education while the faculty of memory is not ignored at present it takes a place subordinate to reason and imagination and sense perception the practical in education through the various departments of naturestudy manual training and laboratory work the faculty for observation is developed and the whole tendency is to make the student more than formerly acrect and thorough acquaintance with nature and its laws must have a tedency to elevate cha1acter the teacher of today who has no interest in the development of moral character is not in sympathy with the prevaing trend in education a man may have a mind stored vith knowledge but we do not consider him educated unless he is at the same time gifted with the practical faculty of a pp lying means to the end he desires to attain and to resort to means or to seek ends that are selfish dishonorable or base is to prove that he is not edcated in any true sense recital the first recital of the music pupils of miss kate calvin of the college musical department occurred on t

we forget to address the chair before we make our remarks but as we hope soon to be given the right of suffrage by the people of montana we shall endeavor to fit ourselves so as to hold our own in parliamentary usages with thos b reed or even the mayor of bozeman vivisection again e v wilcox the various socalled humane societies have for the past two centuries made numerous attempts to secure restrictive or prohibitive legislation on the subject of vivisection the english vivisection act of 1876 is perhaps the most noteworthy this subject ought to be allowed to rest but it is again thrust upon our attention by the washington d c humane society which has for some time been trying to push a bill through congress restricting experiments on animals in the district of columbia this bill has at infinite pains been so framed as not to appear like an attack on vivisection in general but the numerous petty nonsensical strictions in the bill would have the effect of an absolute prohibition upon the main work of the bureau of mal industry now as anyone who is acquainted with the facts knows the work of this bureau has been and is of the utmost importance for the eradication and prevention of animal and human diseases in five years time the bureau succeeded in pletely stamping out that terrible scourge of cattle known as contagious pleuropneumonia the texas cattle fever has been effectively checked and at present the work upon tuberculosis is very encouraging but this bureau with such brilliant achievements to its credit should in the opinion of the washington hncollege exponent mane society be called upon to halt should be hampered by all sorts of worse than usekss restrictions and should be subjected to the ble espionage of men who are edly opposed to experimentation on jiving animals in a case of such pendous impudence as this one may be pardoned for the use of rather strong language we are urged in the name of humanity to put tions on the study of those diseases which are most deadly to man and animals is this the proper ment for the bureau of animal dustry the washington humane society hopes that this proposed law will be the entering wedge to an ultimate prohibition the feeling of the society is expressed in the following sentence from the report of its president for 1894 the subject of vivisection  ments upon animals has been quently before your executive mittee during the past year and but one sentiment has been expressed viz that of utter abhorrence and nation of the inhuman practice which according to the expressed opinions of the best physicians and surgeons is of no practical value to science or cine with regard to this typical sectionstatement i have to say that it shows a lamentable ignorance of  the means by which medicine and gery have been advanced and ly that the latter part of the sentence is a barefaced falsehood the ders of modern surgery have been made possible not by dissections of dead bodies but by experiments upon living animals even the knowledge of the use of anresthetics and tics has been gained by vivisection in physiology single fact has been learned by vivisection the statement that the best physicians and surgeons believe vivisection to be of no practical value is simply not true antivivisectionists often tell us that just as much can be learned about physiology from a dead body as from a living one which simply shows that these people have yet to learn the ference between anatomy and ology there would be fully as much sense in saying that a dead cow wc1uld give milk as well as a live one or that a dead horse would be as good for working purposes as a live horse it seems rather plain that the only way to study physiology is to study ology and not anatomy orsomeother related science no one knew even what was the purpose of the heart and blood vessels until it was strated by vivisection the humane societies have had much to say about the cruelty of these periments but they have never shown a single case or even a reasonable picion of a case where unnecessary pain was caused in experiments by scientific investigators anresthetics are in use in such experiments in this country and in europe the vast majority of the experiments are quite painless and the pain never equals that of socalled natural death by disease experiments upon living animals are always made with the purpose of gaining knowledge which will serve to better the physical condition of man and of the animals upon which he depends for food etc the tific investigators in this line show a much broader humanitarian spirit than does the washington humane society 10 college exponent exchange athletic conference in chicago said the whiskered med to the fair co ed im like a ship at exams are near and

and unwelcome as trouble is it is ever coming to us and because we are heedless and thoughtless how infinite are our wants and therefore how hopeless the chance of avoiding disappointments which come through mistakes and yet very often a few momentsofsoberthoughtbefore we speak or act will perhaps relieve us of what might otherwise have been a lifelong sorrow daily we see faces that are haggard and worn and forms that are weighed down with care and trouble and doubtless if we could read their past history and understand their tions we vould repeat to ourselves how unnecessary what a foolish mistake it is ours to choose a life work and the kind of a life we shall lead and it is mistakes made in such choices that causes so much sin and scandal so many wrecked and unhappy homes and so many broken hearts in our midst it is ours to choose the right or the wrong and whether we choose the one or the other there must be unhappy periods in our lives for even though we choose the right we can

be a great aid in promoting a college spirit and ing the college into prominence a course of lectures would be 111 uch appreciated by the students and the citizens of the city there are many subjects of interest which are rarely mentioned in the newspapers or brought to our notice otherwise but if we could procure the services of some good lecturer for a week or so the attention of the public would be drawn to such lines of thought which are more educational and elevating than those which commonly occur to them the physics department of the lege received another shipment of paratus about the 10th inst the list contains all the apparatus used in the summer school of harvard uversity covering the course known as physics c among other things there is an paratus for producing xrays very good results have been obtained ready with it but of course as is the case with most of the other atus the present quarters are quate for its use to the best tage in order to create an interest in the exponent it is necessary that we should have a large list of regular subscribers the people of the ley and state will not appreciate the paper as much when it is sent free as they would if they had paid thing for il even if the price be ever so small for instance if they should pay only ten cents per year for a iodical they miss it immediately if it fails to reach them for some cause or other but had that paper been sent free to them possibly they would never have missed it when it stopped coming vve do not expect the people to pay for the papers which have been sent to them but would liketo see more interest taken in this enterprise which the students are endeoring to build up there have been a few subscriptions received from farmers of the valley and we trust that there are others who will make it a point to subscribe for the exponent rlistakes in sending sample copies of the exponent the list of taxpayers which was used was copied from the list at the county treasurers office in which the names were alphabetically arraed vvhen it was desired to send copies to certain post offices in the county the task of commencing at the head of the list and then glancing through all of the names was one which could not be well performed without making errors especially vvhere the work was trusted to seral different students we have now revised our mailing list and trust that not more than one sample copy be sent to any one person heafter college exponent 3 faces hattie street watching the faces of the students as they were passing to and fro the thought came to me how varied and onderful is the work of gods hands as he bas photographed life and acter upon the human face no two expressing or showing the same thoughts or mode of life not until we think of the millions of people who inhabit the globe do we comprehend hat all this means what a wonderful study it is ing ever arid anon the history of a life as written upon the face there is passing now one whose face speaks of determination and strength weak lines are there to mar the future next comes one whose life has been guarded from the trials thus far in lifes journey and yet we think it is well for that face could never have passed through shadow and storm xow comes one whose very life means gladness and sunshine hut strength and purity reign within then comes a face once een not easily forgotten youth in all its strength is here and one expects to find a high and noble puritybut no the sin of unholy thought and word are slowly tracing their indelible lines which neither time nor eternitv can erase look againa face so strong and pure and noble there is no doubt what the future will be for resolution and determination are there as one after another passed and passed many thoughts came to me faces seen long years ago seemed as fresh as though but yesterday and then the thought carnewhv the face which bears the narks of a pure unsullied life leaves its picture on our mincls as a lesson toward the right and the face all scarred with passion leaves its impress of the night watch the faces of the aged learn the watchword of tlieir lives choose the one which bears the tokens of well filled years of truth and right so surely as was pronounced the curse of cain so surely is it carried now in our foreheads are the prints of a11 our thoughts and words and actions for as our hearts are so are we and thus we come to see the fluence of our lives upon others as ye speak the kindly word perform the kindly deed our faces receive the impression and so looking at us those about us read the motives of our lives and are brought to know the evil and the good let us then le slow to anger ever ready to do good live a life so kind and gentle doing ever as we should locals

wilcox says that he has not seen such fine weather for some time and that montana weather cannot be compared v1ith that of boston where a person is compelled to wear gum boots to school occasionally there is some talk ot organizing a tate league of oratory between the four colleges in this state which confer degrees if this league is organized there will be an annual contest between the students of the different institutions we are once more glad to note that our friend and former student ed thompson has lately entered college ed was one of the first students who placed his name upon the list of this institution his smiling countenance ca11s to memory pleasant events of the past the following are the names of those who enrolled during the latter part of the fall term samuel j crouch of

with sufficient intensity so that by means of the fluoroscope the bones of the hand may be seen distinctly a young man walking m front of the ferris block a few days ago picked up something which he thought was a rock and threw it at a horse near by but missing the horse it crashed through a brick building on the opposite side of the street the rock was examined and found to be a piece of fluorite a eral usually characterized by its hardness a certain person wishing to enter school enquired for the professor of the business department the fact was discovered that there were many dents in the city of bozeman who did not know that such a man was nected with the institution this plains what interest is shown by some people in college affairs bly they will soon awaken to the fact that there is really a college located at bozeman there is very little work going on at the college buildings at present the weather has been exceptionally fine and much more work has been accomplished than was anticipated at the beginning of winter the chemical building requires a great amount of work on the interior fore it will be ready for use from 6 college exponent the appearance of the building as it is at present we can form a slight conception of how college hill wm appear when all the buildings are completed the bozeman hotel has been open to the public almost a year and the people of the city have learned how great an advantage it is to have a hotel running which they can mend to their friends the traveling men find the hotel convenient ters under the present management of mr ed l stowe some of the residents of the city have learned that they can board at the hotel and have the advantage of all modern conveniences which are required to make life pleasant in the college collection there is a fossil of a fish which is rather cult for a person to determine the position that it occupied in the water during life a discussion arose tween the professor and one of the stud en ts in geology as to which was the upper side of the imal both contestants were fident that their opinions were rect so neither of them would give up but they agreed to submit the matter to dr wilcox for arbitration the one who had the false impression of the position of the animal is to give an oyster supper to the class in gy prof cobleigh and arbitrator rejected contributions the exponent like every other publication on earth must ally decline some work offered to it unlike most other publications ever the exponent is willing and g1ad to criticise all manuscripts mitted by members of the college and either to put the writers in the way of making the paper submitted available or at least to help them to bring future work up to the rements this means a good deal of labor for us and some work for you who are requested to help us in ing this paper the success that we all wish to see to the youth of our school and the present scanty ment in the upper college classes is due the fact that as compared with the older institutions we have not many experienced writers for our work we are not likely therefore  to decline any meritorious work for a long time to come the work mitted to us is subject to two tests does it do credit to our school and will it interest our readers it is very easy to put ones own thoughts down in such a way as to entertain ones self exceedingly it is not so easy to interest others there is no better way to find out what sort of work is likely to interest ers than to study the contents of those papers that are most sful in the sort of work we are trying to do it is to be hoped that our new library will afford room for the regular filing of our exchanges which include some of the most successful college papers published change of name desired the name given to this institution in the act authorizing its estament is the agricultural college of montana our desire to have the name changed from the agricultural college of montana to the montana state college arises from the fact that the present name is a misnomer in that it gives an erroneous and very narrow idea as to the scope and pose of the college both the design college exponent   l range of work of these land an cl grant colleges are clearly forth  the first morrill act which set 111 t 30 000 acres of the public lands apa1   for each senator and representative in congress for the mamtenance of aid colleges section 4 of said act stipulates how the moneys derived from the sale of said lands shall be invested and that the interest shall be inviolably propriated by each state which may take and claim the benefit of this act to the endowment support and tenance of at least one college where the leading object shall be without excluding other scientific and cal studies and including military tactics to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts in such ner as the legislatures of the states may respectively prescribe in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions of life  the second morrill act of 1890 states that the money given to each of these colleges for their more plete endowment and support is to be applied only to instruction in agriculture the mechanic arts the english language and the various branches of mathematical physical natural ahd economic science with special reference to their applications in the industries of life and to the facilities for such instruction  it will be seen that while agriculture is included yet it is but one of many subjects that are required to be taught in these colleges these colleges were specially tended for the benefit of the industrial classes and the design was to adapt the work to the peculiar conditions and requirements of the states in which they might be located the mechanic arts must for mahy years  take precedence of agriculture in this state much more has been spent and must continue to be spent in mechanical than in agricultural lines for these and other reasons the name ignores entirely the most portant and most popular feature of our work we are thoroughly equipped for giving courses in chanical civil electrical or tion engineering yet no one would infer that such is the case from the name given to the institution the apparatus and equipment are iarly adapted for special work in the various sciences but the name would indicate that our work is confined to the science of agriculture while owing to our industrial conditions it is by far the smallest part of our work under the conditions that prevail in our state the present name is a great disadvantage and injury to the institution and the state as many students go outside our state for a technical or engineering education while this institution is prepared both as to its faculty apparatus and other facilities to give them a liberal education in these various lines at home exchange with the beginning of the new year comes a liberal supply of among them the first issue of our mutual friend a neat wide awake little magazine edited by the young

society are doing good work under the present system of conducting affairs at the beginning of the school year the society was reorganized the membership was restricted to the male students of the college the meetings were not to be open to the public except on special occasions past experience proved that the college exponent arena could not prosper and do good l when the doors were open to wor   the public the prmc1ple reason was that some members ften had the  pression that pubhc patronage 11n  was all that was necessary to give lfe and vigor to a literary society 1  disregarding the fact that their presence when their names appeared on the programme rendered much sistance to other members and vented irregularities from occurring in the exercises of the evening there are

are for its young men the west affords a great many portunities for the young men of the present generation if they will only take advantage of the ities which are before them they will aid this remote section of the united states to rise into prominence and to be recognized in the commercial and other important interests of the world there are three great fields which are open for the energetic student of the west one is journalism the others are mining and electrical eering it is evident that the western try will finally reach a standing among other prosperous sections of the united states apd of europe this section has never had the vantage to develop along the lines of popular investigation that those tions of longer settled countries have where journalism and engineering have been carried on for many years the resources of the west are almost boundless and the time is approaching when other sctions of the globe will be compelled to call upon the west for some of the portant minerals which are not being mined at present the young men of the west should not hesitate to take hold of the ing and electrical advantages which are before them because these are the principle fields which afford the est scope for investigation anl1 action the mining industry wi11 not remain in a state of partial stagnation for an indefinite time because the minerals of the west will soon be used more extensive in the development of the the country than they have been since the west first commenced to prove according to the calculations of geologists the coal supply in land will be exhausted in one dred and ten years if the annual production and consumption of coal increases there proportionally as it has during the past few years this means that the englishmen wlll use more coal from other countries as it becomes more difficult to obtain in their own electrical science is reaching into all parts of the inhabitated portions of the world and it is into the greater part of all other scientific researches and into the majority of the industries it has not only gone out of its sphere and made its appearance on the most portant industries of the country but it has even been used to affect politics to a great extent it is becoming an important factor in our political campaigns jouism is last but not least as the facts of all i he preceding events must be made known to the public so the newspapers and magazines of the land will be expected to keep us posted on everything that takes place in these particular lines the field for good journalists is always open but the newspaper and magazine editors in the west and northwest have not risen into ular favor as those have where the country is better adapted to give support to their enterprises

pears that the proportion of college students in the united states hould be more than one man in every two thousand the uses of good literature the best service that can be rendered to the young is to inspire them with an ardent love for good literature whatever the advantages may have been the education is very deficient if there has not been oped a

the resources which it furnished the promptitude and facility which it communicated and the wide field it opened for analogy and illustration one of the chief uses of literature is tht it larges the

to realize their relation to all life and all history while the best literature is cheap and good libraries are withiu reach of nearly all thue is no excuse for ignorance matthew arnold has put the same truth in these  the plea that this or that man has no time for culture will vanish as soon as we desire culture so much that we begin 14 college exponent to examine seriously into our present use

dvance the students of the colleges of the two dakotas are in hopes that tana and iowa will join the western league of oratory which association was organized about one year ago by the representatives of the north and south dakota colleges the plan proposed is that each state is to have a state oratorical contest ceding the interstate contest those who a
re victorious in the contest tween the several colleges of the state are to represent the state in the ern league contest which is to take place sometime near the latter part of the school year we received notice from the cliolian literary society that a resolution had been passed to discontinue the cliolian society advertisement in the exponent if the business men of the city did not feel more interested in the success of the exponent than the ladies society of the college the paper would have been a victim of financial distress long before the ent time but we are still hopeful of avoiding the horrors of a financial failure even if the students do tempt to knock our props out from under us and cause us to walk on wooden pegs ivith crutches the college buildings will be ready for use next year at present the wall of the main building is plete to th

dreary one as the warm spring days will tempt the student to neglect his studies in order to secure a position on the south side of some building where he can enjoy the full benefit of the rays proceeding from the sun all efforts to create interest in a state oratorical contest appear to have ceased it is probably too late now to engage in a state contest this year but the colleges should ize an oratorical association in order to have everything arranged for a contest during the following year through the columns of some of our colorado exchanges we notice that the contest of that state was a grand success and there was such an amount of enthusiasm created that the event will not be forgotten by those who were interested 2 college exponent since the last issue of this paper thete has been a change in the istration of our national government at high noon on march 4th grover cleveland stepped out and william mckinley for many years known all over the country as the champion of protective tariff took the chair as patriotic citizens we hope that having for the chief tive of our government a man who was a distinguished soldier in the civil war who was for many years a potent factor in the national legislature and lately governor of the state of ohio the next four years will be a period of prosperity for our country students who have attended this college for three or four years in the present humble quarters look with a longing eye to college hill where the new buildings are under way when they entered college it was with the thought that long ere this the new quarters would be occupied but year after year they have been disappointed to find that they had to go back to the same old buildings for some departments the present rooms are decidedly and some of the old students who will probably not be back again are what disappointed to think that they have attended four years without getting the benefit of the new ters however the new buildings will in all probability be ready to be cupied when the next school year opens yet we have reason to be gratified at the progress in the erection of such new buildings in the erection of the state capitol building things promise to go slower some 40000 has ready been expended toward the erection of a capitol building and all they have to show for it is a hole in the ground and now operations have been suspended for two years to investigate the matter when some time ago a bill was troduced in the legislature to change the name of the college from the montana college of agriculture and mechanic arts to the lviontana state college we felt sure that it would pass without difficulty but though the bill passed the senate almost unanimously when it came to the lower house it was killed but the college will flonrish theless under the present name if the people of this state but knew what the aim of this college is we are satisfied that it would be more largely patronized an apology in the february number of the ponent we mentioned our regrets that the cliolian literary society of the college had withdrawn its advertisement we were informed afterwards that the ladies had all agreed that by subscribing for the exponent they would render more assistance than by leaving their vertisement in the paper although the ad had not been officially voted upon and ordered out we did not understand the situation and ing that the ladies had decided to withdraw their support from the enterprise it appeared that we were soon to face a dilemma not that the one advertisement would saye the exponent from the pit falls of the irregular and dangerous road in journalism but the mere recognition from the flourishing society of the young was of more college exponent 3 value to the enterprise than dollars and cents as there was a misunderstanding both upon our part and upon the part of the ladies we trust that they w1ll pardon us for our premature action locals a new student has

been able to learn all were successful the open meeting of the arena was enjoyed greatly by all who attended and the young gentlemen are to be gratulated upon doing such good work miss retta hanson of pony a graduate of the business department has several times recently been a very welcome visitor to the business partment there was no cooking class on day march 5 on account of the ing of the water pipes the students were very sorry for the work is so enjoyable the winter term closes in about two weeks and examinations take place this time at least in the minds of the students is not one of joy and many long faces are to be seen in the spring term the class in erature will take up work in peare reading two or more of his plays this will prove quite an agreeable change from the present work

are beginning to drop out and hope that no great number may be forced to leave mrs marshall gave a very ing talk the second of a series to the cliolian society these talks are about a trip abroad and the girls are very anxious for more of them they think that since the imaginary trip is so delightful the real one must be very fascinating indeed we hear that some of the young gentlemen of the college are ing the fact that next year they will possibly have to eat some of the ing of the domestic science class we wish to condole with them but if the young gentlemen who are doing their own cooking can eat that condolence is out of place  udging from the protests which have arisen from the cliolian lerary society upon the presentation of certain billsthe arena oil bill or the exponent advertising bill for instanceone might think that the financial affairs of that honorable body were soon to pass into the hands of receivers there are at present about thirty students taking the business course this being nearly twice the attendance of any former year a casual visitor to this department might well be prised at the businesslike way in which transactions are carried on and the skill and neatness with which the hooks are kept a great many of the students haye been quite disappointed at the way in which the proposed gymnasium has fallen through after the action taken by the students shortly before the holidays a number of the boys however have clubbed together and procured boxing gloves and some very sharp encounters have taken place in witness whereof an ocal black eye

model of the mayflower elder brsters chair and the cradle of pegrine white the first child born in the colony the slope above town square is known as burial hill this is the final resting place of all those who survived the first winter the most prominent is in the form of an obelisk erected to the memory of william bradford the second governor of the colony the oldest stone is to the memory of ed ward gray and is dated 1681 the graves up to this date were left marked because the colonists were too poor to afford grave stones there are many quaint inscriptions on the head stones and the visitor who leaves without making a careful search a very interesting perience the fort of the little colony was located on burial hill and this site was chosen to command leyden street below and the approaches over which the indians might come a marble slab now marks the spot where the fort stood in addition to the fort there was erected in 1643 a brick vatch tower the location of which is now indicated by four stone posts from the brow of the hill a fine viev can be had of the harbor and its surroundings the ground below us gradually slopes to the waters edge and beyond a little way 1s

landing place of the exploring party sent from the mayflower which was then at incetown harbor directly opposite across the bay the next day being sunday they returned god thanks for their many

the large room in the ferris block main street bozeman used by the home science department of the ricultural college for sewing room dining room and kitchen laboratory is open to visitors the same as other college class rooms the above is just a commonplace announcement its only merit being its truthfulness events have proven that it is able to announce further that visitors to this department are expected to open the door and walk in on both feet in fact just as they would enter any room the reason for this nouncement extraordinary lies in the fact that times unnumbered the mates of the department room have been startled by a loud clattering of boots on the outside of the door fol  lowed by the sudden appearance and as sudden disappearance of a hat brim without eyes above the curtain rod such a manntr of visiting the may be called unsightly m every sense of the word and must be unsatisfactory as well for the benefit of those who areunacquainled with the laws of gravitation we firm that the unsupported suspension of any human body in the space around the front door of the home science department rooms is an possibility to stand on a box of ficient height to bring the eyes above the curtain rod might be ient to be by the neck at the right elevation might be fortable and lead to mistaken sions on the part of the passers by so as we before remarked open the door and walk in on both feet soon after entering do not be startled by a heavy rumbling sound like thunder accompanied by a fine shower of dust it is not a volcanic eruption but the business department moving about overhead noisy but harmless do not let it deter you from pursuing your investigation without fear and without favor the north end of the long room is used for a sewing room anci office being furnished with a ing machine folding work tables chairs and a desk the middle of the room is used for a dining room a dining table is the only furniture in this space at present in the south end of the room is found the kitchen laboratory and it is very generally considered the most interesting tion it is furnished with long terlike tables with drawers divided into compartments for the dation of utensils each student hav ing a complete outfit tor her own use there is also a fine majestic range with double ovens charcoal broiler and hot water tank and plenty of hot and cold water space does not permit a detailed account of the whole equipment but there are plenty of the best utensils for present use here the young women belonging to the freshman class of the college course cook twice a week all foods that are ordinarily used in the daily diet of the american citizen will be cooked with the intention on the part of the cooks to improve the flavor of io college exponent the food increase its digestibility and preserve within the food its nutrition instead of depositing these valuable substances in frying pans or sending them into solution with the water in which the food is cooked to be thrown away under present conditions only small amounts of food are cooked and this the cooks themselves consume with good appetites and perfect impunity definite directions are given and act measurments required law is substituted for luck and no mental cooking is permitted in the freshman cooking classes jokes by outsiders regarding the unpleasant consequences following upon and the risks involved in the consumption of food cooked by the college girls in this department are received by the cooks and their er with such patience and forbearance as politeness demands but are sidered

goes on a bust the long sunny afternoon was drawing to a close the monotonous buzzing of the business world had most ceased when in the distance a storm cloud arose in the shape of q whisperthe great college al bank is going to failinstantly all was excitement every nerve was strained in the endeavor to reach the business windows and withdraw the money there on deposit the paying teller and cashier acting on the principal of first come first served counted out money until all but the reserve fund was gone the bank then suspended leaving bers of depositorsas one expressed itforty miles from home and not a cent of money  business was tied up those who had money would not invest it and those who had none simply folded their hands and did nothing we can readily see the cause of this panic the want of confidence if some of the heavy depositors had saidi have confidence in my bank and its ability to tide over this culty it would have carried weight and influence in the business world the bank would then have had time to call in some of its time loans ing the depositors on a sure footing and making a large dividend in favor of the stockholders b m the joint discussion between the two literary societies of this college march 20th should be an ment to our students to enter into 2 college exponent a contest with some of the colleges of the state of montana there has been an attempt to organize an interstate league of oratory but all efforts have been of no avail if the colleges of the state would join in a few friendly contests tween themselves then it would he an easy matter to encourage the tors to enter into an oratorica1 test with th2 representatives from the colieges of the adjacent staics the attention of the mayor and the city fathers is respectfully called to the fact that there will soon he need of some sidewalk facilities tween the town and the college grounds those who are doing work at the college buildings at ent have to ford the mud holes at frequent intervals and suffcr much wear and tear of temper and good clothes in the process next year one or two hundred people will be under the necessity of going over this ground several times a day and they ought not to be compelled to depend on the car line for all portation in bad weather sides the co1lege buildings are likely to become more and more a resort for the people of the town as they are gradually equipped and the grounds put in attractive shape even now many people would like an opportunity of looking over the new buildings and seeing the progress if there were any way of doing so at least two different lines of walk should be constructed soon and the routes should be chosen to commodate the largest possible ber of people it would be well for our athletic students to note that ve have a liitle less than two months time fore field day the tudcnts of the eastern colleges began training for theirintercollcgiatc contests a month ago which gives them a long siege of training but lightens the work the acl vantage of a few min utcs work each day continued ocr a lonr period of time rather than i wo three hours each day for a week or two may be clearly seen by whose time for such work is limitcu owing to onr present location and luck of conveniences it is certai11ly impossible to do rcgultr training ct lhis time of the year therefore our students should make it their dutv to take advantage of every day fa orable for work it is hoped that as soon as the weather will permit every student who is interested in field dav exercises base ball teams or any kind of athletic sports will begin active work and strive to have a fidel day program which will be yorthy of the attention of those vl10 may come to the exercises the new dri11 ha11 100 x 60 feet will be fitted for a gymnasium in the future it will be sufficiently large for a one hundred yard running track also large enough for indoor base ba11 practice which will be a great advantage over the present tions the joint discussion bctccn the zcthegathian and arena literary societies march 20th resulted in favor of the former by the attention of the audience that was present it appears that there was a great deal of interest manifested in the cuban question which was the subject of controyersy the question was stated as follows resolved that the united states college exponent 3 should recognize the cubans as be11igcrants    the arena des1nng to retahate sent a challenge to the victors but we have been informed that the zcthcgathians do not desire to enter into another joint discussion until some time during the school year the foot ball team of the college rcccfrcd a challenge from the butte high school team also one from the ijutlc business college to play a game in our town on college field dav rrhc glory of making the invincible team of the butte high school bite the dust and the thought of pushing the pig skin over their line caused the foot ball fever to run high in our gridiron men and as a result a meeting was called immediately to consider the challenges but to the ment of the foot hall players the base ball sentiment prevailed in the ing and after 111 uch discussion it was rleeidecl to play base ball for the sport of the coming term a committee was appointed to purchase the essary material and practice will bc0in as soon as possible one of the most significant ditions to the work of the ities and colleges of this country cluring the last few years has been the offering of limited portions of the lniyersity and college curricula to tho e who were not able to avail themselves of such advantages by the ordinary method this movement called generally by the namp of yersi ty extensions has apparently ained a permanent place in many tates east and west and though still a humble educational factor is  a promising one the lecture cently given by dr f w traphagen and the large attendance suggest that a course of lectures arranged to include perhaps six or ten connected and systematic might give to those who wished to enlarge their mental horizon a profitable opportunity the professors in their various ialties might many of them arrange to give such series of lectures both in bozeman and perhaps in many other places near by or easily cessible from here while such work is not the equivalent to the hearers  of a college course it docs in many places go far towards being a stitute for it in some places upon the completion of such a course of lectures an examination is offered and all who pass that are credited at the college represented by the turer with a certain proportion of a years work which may be cotmtcd toward a diploma why would it not be a good plan to inaugurate such a system here in lviontana locals mr i k wisner was out of school

the exponent it is hoped that the exponent wi11 continue to improve as it has in the past and that it will soon be one of the most popular periodicals lished in the great northwest this is the last issue of the ent for the school year of 967 so we have continued our numbering under vol 1 which makes this issue number 13 as there arebut twelve months in a year we feel that it is essary to make an explanation why this monthly perodical should have thirteen numbers issued under vol 1 during the latter part of the winter term of 956 the complete control of the exponent was placed in the hands of the students and the paper was changed from a quarterly to a monthly but the former publications were issued under vol i and the bering was continued from the last issue of the quarterly there are to be but nine issues of the exponent during each school year so we gest to our succeisors that there should be only nine numbers issued in each volume the issue next tember should begin as vol ii no 1

arrangements for an exceptionally fine programme and if the weather permits some great sprinting bicycle riding jumping and other athletic exercises will be seen it is expected that a large crowd will attend these events and a person could not spend a lay more enjoyably than to come and join the spectators on the 7th of june the post graduates are getfo1g to be quite domineering they look clown

day at the station dr wilcox wonders what is the matter with his pupils one of the botany students was to find the analytical key of the botany in the physiology mr fred wylie of the business

teased by the girls we advise the young ladies to be more tender hearted a short time ago the chemistry class were somewhat surprised to learn that there would be no more review work carried on hereafter fore examinations one of the fessors said the reason why this stand was taken was to teach the students that they must depend upon themselves for review work mrs marshall has nearly all her art class out sketching during classes in the assembly room varied and numerous remarks are heard from the sketchers near the windows such as you can sit here if you leave room for my feet and the retort if you put your feet up there you wont be able to see anything else to draw four of the students were taking a walk the other evening when the young ladies made the remark that they were going to wellesly one of the bright stars who is to attend columbia replied yes and do you want to know what degree you will receive and when the young ladies asked what it was to be remarked d c which means to begin over again it is rumored that the art tion will be open one week before the i closing of the college it promises to be a fine exhibition and will be well worth a visit by those

students has not yet resulted in any organized effort to play the game there are two courts still unappriated in the enclosed grounds where the faculty play and a few minutes work with a rake would put them in tolerable shape for playing there is no reason why we should not have a strong college team in this game not half the boys in the college are at present taking any form of regular exercise and there can be no better sport f01md than such as tennis offers college exponent 5 one of the most important changes made this year in the arrangements for the commencem exercises is the  establishment of an intersociety con  test the final arrangements as to prizes and judges are not yet nounced but the contest will include three different forms oratory ation and essay each society

program as all the speakers are being well drilled by miss owens the inhabitants of the city of man have until lately been sleeping in deadly terror lest that flat car run at an unusual rate of speed by those terrible college boys should jump the track and continue its onward way thro ten or fifteen houses however it appears there are no grounds for this fear for bozeman possesses a police force unsurpassed in courage and daring so when one of the night watchmen interfered with this terrible infringement of the laws of the city of bozeman the young gentlemen did not retreat as thcv surelv would have done had thct knon with whom they had to deal on the contrary they stood  houlclcr to shoulder and when the policeman tried to send one of the younger criminals home the lad obstinately refused to go and re mained true to his confederates having th us corralled a band of peradoes who have been the terrot of this community at large imagine the surprise of the honest and right citizens generally to find there was nothing in the of the city whereby these daring  young men could be prosecuted they were therefore turned loose and have undoubtedly by this time sought their mountain fastness whence they will probably swoop down again upon the street car lines where there are no police and begin their death dealing depredations bozeman can congratulate herself upon having such a brave and trusty police force all honor to their deeds as to the raven some weeks ago one of the students in the class in american literature called attention to the fact that man in his poets of america tioned the difficulty a bout the position of the lamp criticised in the november number of the exponent the sentence is as follows if the shadow of the bird could not fall upon the mourner the ows of its evil presence could brood upon his soul  more recently came the information from e h kronshage editorinchief of the daily cardinal of madison wisconsin that the criticism in regard to the position of the lamp is almost as old as the poem itself and appeared in the hartford review soon after the publication of the poem in writing to a dent who had made a reply to this article poe himself says college exponent for the purpose of poetry it is quite sufficient that a thing should be possible or at least that the probability be not offensively glaring it is true that in several ways as you say the lamp might have thrown the birds shadow on the floor my conception was that of the bracket candelabrum affixed against the wall high up above the door and bust as is often seen in the english palaces and even in some of the better houses of new york this explanation doesnt seem very easy and it is not remarkable that it was overlooked or ignored by mr stedman it is also interesting to note that in the illustration by mr a e sterner in the berry edition the lamp appears on the table though this might be strued as artistic license the ill tra ti on in the recent edition by pincott perhaps is meant to show poes conception locals mr oliver foster of middlecreek left school recently to go to work at home miss gertrude brandley was absent from school a few days

the subject of chosing a tional flower or floral emblem she argued that a rleliberated choice of such an emblem was unprecedented and unwise the significance of such emblems for other nations depends

that they are numbered from 010 to 999 and take pains to return each volume to its proper place according to the numbers on the lables it would be a great help to the person having charge of the library a title catalogue is being made 10 college exponent which will be of assistance to anyone wishing a book the name of whose author he does not know neither the title nor the author catalogues are used by the students the few minutes necessary to explain them the librarian will willingly give to anyone and the use of the catalogue will save much useless searching by students and many extra steps for the librarian the government publications are not classified as in present quarters there is no room for them and for the same reason the reports for the ious experiment stations are stacked promiscuously but another year in all probability these valuable ence books and pamphlets will be accessible to the students mro vanilla made from the genuine vani11a bean cooks try it the bozeman

were of unusual interest the co11ege graduated its fifth student from the regular college course and this was quite an event in itself the preparatory and uate exhibition which took place on the evening of june 10th was very entertaining the programme ing of essays declamations and tions with vocal and instrumental music to give it variety seven students graduated from this ment four students finished the keeping course and three graduated in shorthand andtypewriting six young ladies completed the postgraduate course in business and each received the degree of master of accounts another attraction of ment week was the annual concert given by the musical department of the college the first part of the programme was instrumental music by miss calvins pupils the second part was the last act from  the bohemian girl  this is the first time the department has attempted any work in opera and showed what home talent can do this concert was a grand success and one of the pleasant features of commencement week the commencement of 97 was by far the most interesting in the tory of the college and as the college grows we believe ment will become more and more important not only to the

been searching in every nook and corner for plant forms to draw but soon the snow will come and all their joys will cease they will spend the remainder of the year in object drawing or in drawing from plaster casts of which there is a supply the work from nature m plant forms tends in two as an aid to future work 1t 1s uable and also a student lates of natural and ful plant forms available for tive work and ornamental design two art lectures are given each week and during the present term they are upon  historic ornament and the great principles which underlie all true art work at present the classes ing these lectures are required to bring in designs from plant and flower forms just as they found them in nature and arrange them for borders for wall paper fans book covers etc as they make further progress in industrial design they will submit conventionalized ornament and design for carving wall papers and other practical work college yell it has been suggested the students get up a college yell it will be membered that there was a college yell in the early history of the college but for the last two years there has not been much interest taken in this direction now that foot ball is on the boom and we have an instructor in military tactics the next thing to do is to get an appropriate yell especially do we need a good yell before the foot ball team plays very many games because it happens that a game will hinge on the amount of yelling that is done then again it shows that there is a college spirit among the students such as should prevail in all colleges let some one try his mind at composing a college yell and thus start the ball a rolling a reception for the foot ball team it is understood that the  cliolian literary society will give a reception to the foot ball eleven at or near the end of the foot ball season this shows that the young ladies ested in foot ball to some extent and while they cannot go on the field of battle they can show their college enthusiasm by giving them a grand reception after the victories have been won the young men will no doubt appreciate any kindness offered by the young ladies in this direction and if they are defeated in their first attempts at playing foot ball they will be so aroused by wellearned ognition that by the time another foot ball season comes aiound we may expect an unbroken record of victories a general reception there has been only two receptions given for the students during the four years that the college has been in existence one was given during the first year in the academy building the second was in the city union it seems that the three literary eties should consider something of this kind and devise some means by which they can make the new dents feel at home and bring all new and old into pleasant social relations college exponent there are students who come here and stayed for some time before they got acquainted with any number of their fellow studenti unless they are in the same classes and there they meet but a small proportion of the students one great drawback along this line has been the lack of an ideal place but nevertheless the academy building could be fixed up

one wanting to subscribe will please call on or write to mr ed burk who will very gladly receive their subscription the chemical building is almost completed at last all the college paratus has been

water works is connected with chemical building and is ready to be turnei on the heating ratus is in working order and also the gasoline tank it will take a few days to get the apparatus cleaned and straightened out but the students are already at work and everything will soon be in convenient form the first of the college free lectuer course was given in the christian church on saturday night nov 20th by mr walter harvey weed of the geological survey his subject being the yellowstone national park it was illustrated by means of the stereopticon and many of the most interesting scenes were shown mr weed began his lecture by giving the history of the park and surrounding country from the earliest known logical times down to the present mr weed has spent ten summers in the park and is probably the most well informed scholar in regrad to its formation and history bunsens theory of the geyser was shown by means of a long glass tube with a flask at the bottom vvater was pored into the tube and when heated would shoot out in the form of a geyser pres reid introduced mr weed and at the close of his lecture pres reid said that he was glad to know that the scientific record of the lege had been maintained for last year when one of the college boys who was employed in the park was asked why it was that the stone river has so many turns in it he replied in early days the river got full and was still on a bender the next ledure will be on december 3 these lectures will probably tend through the winter months and will be on a variety of subjects the college has much to late itself upon in the pleasant tions gradually being established with the good people of the town larly the business men that the lege shall help the town has been expected from the very beginning this it has already done in affording to many young people opportunity for special oradvanced work that they could not otherwise have obtained besides this however less directly it is beginning help the commercial interests of the town by bringing new and desirable residents students and families progress in this direction will be more apparent and more steady year by year bozemans commercial possibilities are likely to be pretty rigidly limited by its situation the town can draw trade at best from only a limited territory the college can and ought to draw students from the whole state it is now spending thousands of dollars here which would never be brought here wise within a few years it is likely to become the best enterprise of the town commercially considered alone the college could exist here without any assistance from the town but it never do its best without the college exponent 3 hearty cooperation of the people of bozeman the popularity of the college throughout the state and its power to draw students will depend partly and largely upon the way in which students are received treated and encouraged by townspeople here it is therefore a pleasure to record the kindness and generosity with which people have responded to many calls made upon them in the interests of the students money has been given freely and aid and ment of other sorts while the nent still makes an appeal for more cordial support of the college paper it nevertheless gladly acknowledges the kindly spirit which is manifest and offers the thanks of the students an interesting ileeting on friday afternoon nov 12 at 5 oclock the cliolian literary society held a special meeting at which time they presented the college foot ball team with a very fine banner it was made of blue and gold satin to sent the college colors it was trimmed with gold fringe and on each side there was a large m ponding to those on the foot ball suits only made in a much more tistic manner miss hattie street presided at the meeting and she made a short address on the benefits of gymnastic exercises mr harry terson then responded as captain of the foot ball team and thanked the young ladies for the honor they had shown the foot ball players foot ball the first game for the agricultural college of montana on saturday morning nov 13th about thirtyfive of the college boys together with lieut ahern prof cobleigh dr wilcox and mrs cox started to butte where the lege foot ball team were to play their first game the train was a little late but arrived in butte about 915 the crowd was met at the train by prof mckay who is principal of the high school and also manager of the high school team they took the street car up to the mcdermott and then marched around several blocks giving the college yell occasionally breakfast was served at 10 oclock and at 1100 the team went to the library yard for a few minutes of private practice they then went back to the hotel and remained until twenty minutes before two oclock they and the high school team were then taken in a large carriage which was drawn by four white horses to the athletic park which is near the race track there was a very good crowd in attendance considering the kind of weather the wind was blowing and it was rather chilly to stand out in the open air the colors of both the high school and college were very plentiful on the grounds the elegant banner which was sented to the college team by the cliolian literary society was very conspicious it was carried along in front of the grand stand during the game the game was called shortly after 2 oclock the college had the kick off and the high school returned the ball to the center of the field and lost it on downs the college then gained ground straight through the center and waters got a rush through for a touch down patterson then kicked goal this made the score 6 to 0 in favor of the college this was done within four minutes after the game started and the high school boys were rather surprised at 4 college exponent the way the college boys played ball all kinds of remarks were heard from the grand stand and the crowd in general looked rather pale the high school then kicked to the college who lost the ball promptly then the high school made a touch down through the center but failed at goal the score was then 6 to 4 in favor of the college the college then kicked to the high school who advanced the ball a few yards and lost it on a fumble the ball was then nately in the hands of both sides for some minutes when the high school secured a run around the end the crowd over the side lines kept the college from tackling the man the high school then made a very brilliant kick for a goal the ball was touched down about three yards from side line it was carried in fifteen yards and from here the high school kicked this made the score 10 to 6 in favor of the high school the lege then kicked to high school but neither side scored again during this half an intermission of ten minutes was then taken before the second half patterson sprained his ankle just fore the first half ended and was able to play during the second half millis took his place as half back and did some hard playing brandenburg gave the signals in the second half the high school kicked off and the college boys lost the ball on downs the high school advanced the ball a few yards and adams made a run around left end for a touch down he crossed the line about 20 yards to the left of the goal posts and then ran in behind the goal hopkins then kicked a goal lhe score was then 16 to 6 in favor of high school the college kicked off and soon had possession of the ball they ad  vanced it a few yards and millis made a fine run of 25 yards through right end to a touch down and peat kicked goal the score was then 16 to 12 in favor of high school boyles took a cramp in his leg which caused him much pain for a few seconds he played a few minutes longer but had to leave the field and his place was filled by frank wi11son about the same time chas flaherty was ly injured and had to quit playing thos caldwell took his place the high school made another touch down and kicked goal the college then kicked off but neither side scored during the remainder of the game the final score was 22 to 12 in favor of the high school the officials were time keepers wallace bretherson and dr hagen referee robert ellis umpire dr wilcox altogether it wasa well played game and both sides did good work there was no one seriously hurt but the gravel which was very plentiful on the grounds had a ency to scratch the boys faces the wind was blowing from the south when the game started but as the second half began it changed and came from the north which brought the smoke from the smelters along with it this troubled the college boys 8omewhat as this was the first game for the college team this can be considered an honorable feat but they will probably make the butte boys play still harder when they come to bozeman to play the return game rt gave the boys great satisfaction when they returned to the hotel to learn that the second team of the lege had beaten the high school 20 to 0 the high school boys of butte were yery courteous the college college exponent boys and a large number of them came to the hotel after supper to bid them farewell lieut ahern was well pleased with the game and it has been mostly through his energetic work that the team has made so good a beginning last year they did some practice but failed to range any games and had become somewhat discouraged this is just a beginning and the readers of the exponent may expect further news of them before the season closes the helena vs college football game the college football team left soula at 745 on thursday evening nov 25 and arrived in helena at 2 a m they were met at the depot by a committee of high school students and taken to the grandon on a bob sled as there were no street cars ning at that early hour on friday morning a number of the team went went with lieut ahern to the court house and called on gov smith and some of the other state officials they also visited the historic library which is in the court house and saw many old indian relics they next went to the united states assay office and were shown through it by mr walker one of the men in eharge the melting room was very interesting as they saw the assayer pour a bar of gold worth over 4000 gas and air are used for heating stead of gasoline as in the ordinary assay office they were also shown a brick of gold which was about the size of an ordinary brick and worth over 18000 in the afternoon on friday they took the street car and went out to fort harrison the car went within a mile of the fort and they were taken from there in a four mule sleigh to the fort they were shown through the fort by commanding officer oneill company d and its barracks were of special interest as it was this pany that lieut ahern had charge of when he was appointed to his present position fort custer has been doned and the company will remain stationed at fort harrison this company has a football team and they intended to come to bozeman and play the college team then go on to butte and anaconda and play with teams at those places but their orders were changed and they were pointed in their plans it is probably well enough for our boys that they were disappointed for they have three men in the line that weigh over 620 pounds this fort has been built only about two years it is being improved every year and in time will be the best permanent fort in the state the team went to the high school basement for a few minutes practice on saturday morning about 2 oclock they took the street car for the university grounds where the game was played there were between200 and 300 people out which was a good crowd considering the weather it was very cold with plenty of snow on the ground the gridiron had been partly cleaned off and was in very good shape for playing the game was called at 330 and consisted of two 20 minute halves the high school had the kickoff and the college secured the ball they then made steady gains through the center and sides until moore was pushed through right end for a touch down this was done within seven minutes after the game was started the high school again kicked off and the college advanced the ball as before but lost it a fumble within ten yards of rel college exponent  enas goal the high school then tried bucking center but could not gain any ground and immediately lost the ball on downs moore was again pushed through right end for a touch down the ball was then ed after being brought in for a kick off thereby losing us hvo points on first touch down the college failed at goal the score was then 8 to 0 in favor of college the ball was again kicked off by high school but time was called before it had been advanced very far by the college team the second half started by the lege kicking the ball to high school during the second half neither side scored and the ball was alternately in the hands of both sides the high school made one good play by the quarterback passing the ball to back and then the full passing it back to quarter and he running around left end for a 20 yard gain there was not much end playing as the ground was in poor condition for making any brilliant runs the final score was 8 to 0 in favor of the college team the high school had played the sity several times and always had beaten them and so were somewhat disappointed by losing this game the line up was as follows bozeman high school r boyles center e j moore r g seyler l g t v caldwell r t i cockrill l t w flaherty r e s millis l e h c patterson r h w

some reports have been started that were not true and this would seem to show that some one had a grudge against foot ball or else wanted something to say that the butte team plays a rough game is no reason why all teams do the 2 college exponent game is a little rough but as pared with other games there are rot so many people seriously injured even at bycicling there are more ple killed than at foot ball in spite sidering the fact that nearly every lege and university in the united states has a foot ball team if any one who is not in sympathy with foot ball has another game to suggest in which the same discipline and physical training can be had we would like to hear from them faculty resolution dec 1 1897 resolved that no student ization nor any body of students using the college name shall be mitted to give any entertainment whatsoever without first presenting a written petition to the faculty mittee on student affairs and ing their approval resolved further that this

defeated by a score of 12 to nothing the college scrubs made four more points but time should have been called before this happened during the first half of the game the scrubs made two touchdowns and kicked goal both times the second half was very interesting as neither side could advance the ball very far without ing it millis and will flaherty ted the high school and gave them some valuable help the high school boys play very well and we expect some good material from their eleven by the time they are prepared to enter college this is one reason why they should be encouraged the first team of the college may be strengthened to some extent next year as there have been some boys who have expressed their intention of attending college that will probably make good play ers at any rate we hope

material and social ditions of the people have modified greatly educational ideals and methods the question is being cussed as to whether the educations ofthe schools is adopted to the quirements of theage education properly considered is the ious development of the physicial mental and moral faculties and may always be known by its fruits a lopsided development must result in deformity and that which results in deformity however refined cannot be called education it must be mitted that much of what is called at the present time does not result in harmony when the child acquires a knowlege of physiology and hygene under ditions which produce disease and sickness the product is not harmony but deformity when instead of moral strength the fruit is moral weakness we cannot apply the term education to the process it is sible in the intense desire to store the mind with facts to forget the claims of the physical and moral natures reading writing and ciphering do not constitute an education as many suppose but are simply the tools or means through which an education can be obtained if they are properly used there are but few who would deny to any the right of an but it may frequently happen in the process called education that the person is unfitted in one sphere in life and is not fjtted for any other when the result is discontent and a contempt for labor without any development of capacity for productiveness or joyment without any growth of character there is no education in the true sense universal education is an idea comparatively new plato did not include it in his model wealth england introduced it less than a generation ago germany rose to the ideal in the present tury and while the people of the united states believe in the education of all the people they are face to face with the question what is the best education for all as manual labor must be the itage of the large majority the child should be taught the use of tools he should have impressed upon his mind the dignity of honest toil if this is entirely neglected in his tion we need not wonder that ual labor will be a last resort and will be continued so long as necessity demands it is of the utmost portance that children in our cities and towns should have facilities for training in accurate handwork one of the most serious features of the concentration of our population in cities is that manual training is nied them president elliot says ganized education must supply in cities a good part of the manual and  moral training which the cooperation of children in the work of father and mother affords in agricultural nmnities such training will vide in large measure the physical culture needed in education as to the moral side of culture every child should be taught that the highest attainment possible in life is strength and beauty of character 4 college exponent the pupil should be taught that the best and truest citizen is he who knows be3t his duty as a member of society that he is in no sense educated who is selfish or greedy or brutal in his intercourse with his fellowmen foot ball the college vs butte high school the last game of foot ball that the college team will play this year came off here on december 4th this was thefourth gamethattheyhaveplayed and w bile they came out victorious in only one they did good hard playing in all and know much more about the game than they did two months ago the college team met the high school team at the bozeman hotel at 1230 and marched from there to the foot ball grounds the were led by the band and followed by the college cadets in uniform the grounds were in very good condition and the weather could not have been much better there was a large crowd in attendance and as this was almost the first game of foot ball ever played in bozeman it made it difficult for everyone to understand the game the game was called shortly after one oclock and our boys had the off patterson kicked the ball far into butler field and dawson advanced the ball a few yards and was downed the high school then made steady gains until within five yards of the college boys goal here the high school could not gain further and so lost the ball on downs patterson made a left end play and gained ten yards after another play or two the college lost the ball on a fumble the high school then made a touchdown and kicked goal score 6 to 0 in favor of high school patterson again kicked off and the high school advanced the ball a few yards they then made a play through left end and one of their players made a run of twentyfive yards but was outrun and downed by waters the high school then made another touchdown but failed to kick goal the college again kicked to high school and they succeeded in making another touchdown and kicked goal score 16 to 0 in favor of high school this ended the first half of the game the second half began by the high school kicking the ball to the college chas flaherty caught the ball vanced it a yards and was downed by brown who made a foul tackle which gave the college fifteen yards the college boys then gained the center of the field and patterson made an end run of thirty yards the ball was then in the hands of both sides alternately for some time and neither could make any great gains the high school had the ball within five feet of the college boys goal line when they made a fumble and boyles fell on the ball seyler then made a run through left end and with the good interference of c flaherty and moore and was lowed a clear field to run through this was the play of the season and could not be done once in a thousand times a longer run could scarcely be made for when the ball was passed from the full back to the quarter back it was outside the end line this was rather a surprise to the butte boys as they had held their own until this time time was called before the ball was kicked off again and so the final score was 16 to 6 in favor of the high school the only one that dropped out on account of being hurt was tonkin buttes center rush the was college exponent 5 as follows bozeman boyles moore seyler caldwell cockrill c r g l g r t l t peat r

lines of essays readings declamations debates and parlimentary drill all ot which are very helpful to the students but these two sucieties include by no means all the students why not organize other societies  there is still plenty of good material in the college for work along this line and when you do organize use such care in the selection of officers and tance of members as to render it a rather than a duty to be a member of a college literary society prof curriers lecture the lecture given by prof currier on the subject of italy at the m e church jan 13 was a rare treat the church was packed to its utmost capacity and many were pelled to go a way the first part of the lecture gave us an historical and geographical description of the try and a sketch of its agriculturle and commerce then came a tion of the people and social lifei followed by a history of the works of art and of two of the greatest cities  rome and venice the lecture closed with a description of two landscapes from which we are permitted to quote the following  i had gone out through the city gates late one sunny afternoon and the declining sun found me far away on the campagna di roma or vast and barren plain which surrounds rome for miles in every direction this is the old latium the home of the latin race once rich and fertile filled with populous towns now a dreary unbabited waste roamed by herds of longhorned oxen where ruins dot the plain for lonely miles and where through the long summer month that fearful scourge malaria holds undisputed sway this staling change is due to the neglect of ages and the of agriculture lowing the displacement of small farms by large estates in the last days of the roman republic i bad been waning from rome to naples along the appian way constructed twentytwo hundred years before on which the tramp of the famous legions had so often resounded i became aware that my shadow was growing longer and longer till its extremity was almost lost to view turning to trace my way a scene of weird fasnation lay before me on the left over the livid and limitless green of the campagna the bloodred sun just lingered on the horizon  on the right the alban mountains blushed in the last warm rays and directly ahead the towers of the eternal city sofed by distance stood in silhouette against the cold azure of the north theimposingruins of great aqueducts which supplied old rome with waier from the hills ran off across the plain on either side of the way were the college exponent 3 tombs of noble romans now  a into decay like the bones that lllb 1 they commemorate the s1 ence was preme onlv the spirits of the buried su  past were there the tombs breathed forth their dead and 1t seemed to me that yonder behind those walls rome the mistress of antiquity still drew the breath of pride and then the sun sank down the broad plain was desolate and void and the sad reality of death and decay and the vanitv of human pomp and power came with cruel force an icy chill crept over the dreary waste and the lonesomeness was unbearable i hastened my steps and gained the city gales soon after nightfall a prize the exponent offers a prize of 500 for the best original short story offered available for publication in this paper the story is not to ceed two thousand words and must be in the hands of the editorinchief by the 4th of april 1898 the story

announced later this competition is open to any student in regular standing in any department of the college who is a subrcriber to the exponent the successful story with the name of the winner of the prize will be published in the exponent and honorable mention will be made of the writer getting second place the committee will be powered to withhold the prize if in their judgment no deserving work is handed in all unsuccessful scripts will be returned to the writers unless other arrangements are made the commencement contest  the exponent is authorized to nounce that the contest which made so interesting a feature of our last years commencement is to remain to add interest this year also gold medals will be offered as before for the best written essay the best delivered declamation and the best written and deliyered oration the contest will take place either during mencement week or the week before as may be announced later it will be open to any student in good standing who is enrolled by the registrars in any department and who is taining a satisfactory standard of work in all studies in case of any large number of contestants those who shall take part in the final test will be chosen by preliminary contests the literary societies will take note that they have no ly this year and must look well to their work or they may be beaten incidentally we wonder what has come of our intersociety debates the costume party and faculty re= ception the costume parties given by mrs marshall and the art department have become a feature of college life although they have never been open to anyone outside the art class fore this time the students of all the departments were invited every room in the academy building was thrown open and the larger rooms were draped with the college colors there were about a hundred and fity in costume who assembled in the art room until eight oclock  when they formed in couples for the grand march the parade to the niment of music was a gorgeous sight nearly every nationality on the 4 college exponent globe and a few besides being sented some of these costumes showed great ingenuity in their up the pussycat for instance who was almost perfect except the purr mother goose and mother hubbard and her dog the rose the sunflower and several flower girls were in dence although in the month of j ary clowns gentlemen of the old school and courtly dames were there and our dignified president with curls eyeglass chrysanthemum and all made up the dude foot ball was not forgotten but was sented by a veteran of the game patched together for the occasion with court plaster and bandages the exponent was ably represented by a member of the staff there were many more costumes worthy of notice but lack of space forbids mention after the excitement of the grand march was over the company ed in the assembly room and listened to music sang songs and joined in the college and foot ball yell etc an important feature of the eve nings entertainment was the dainty refreshments served by the domestic science department and consisting of sherbet and marguerites the rest of the evening was spent in visiting and il1 playing games spersed with the antics of the clowns and other comic personages it was nearly twelve oclock when this pleasant party broke up when our new buildings are ready and we can have the use of them these student gatherings should result in binding together more cksely the students of the college in every helpful form of social life the teachers state association the association met in helena on tuesday evening dec 28 and ed in session during the two following days as this was the ninth cotive meeting which the writer has been privileged to attend it was quite natural that he should compare it with preceding ones as a result of such comparison i have no hesitation in saying that in all respects it was the very best in the history of the association the character of the papers and discussions the tone of the teachers and their general ingence the spirit manifested in the work of the association as a whole would compare favorably with that of any other state i believe it is as true of the teachers of lif ontana as it certainly is of her citizens that they will compare with that of any other state in energy and general culture at the meeting held in great falls in december 1896 helena was chosen as the permanent place of meeting this was a move in the right diretion as it takes away one of the incentives to schemes which are liable to develop in a desire to secure for a

vigorous that the lieutenant responded with other ly interesting incidents gen and mrs willson and judge and mrs strong were guests of the evening  to mr h c patterson and others signing the petition pertaining to foot ball the faculty in response to your petition sends the following answer in the form of a resolution resolved that this faculty does approve of intercollegiate athletics under necessary restrictions  that in the judgment of this faculty it is not wise to continue ate foot ball during the remainder of this school year for the following reasons foot ball has been given a fair trial this year in spite of much adverse criticism and much pressure upon the faculty for its prohibition on the whole it can hardly be said that it has gained friends and it is not ed wise to ignore a hostile feeling in our constituency the faculty desires as many as sible of the students to profit by the training which athletics affords and wishes to encourage the greatest variety of manly sports that the greatest possible number of students may be induced to take part incollegiate foot ball would practically prevent the development of all other sports during the remainder o
f the year and would establish a bad predent for future athletic development the development of one form of athletic sport to the exclusion of all others will inevitably tempt those who take part in it to a neglect of regular work the one danger which threatens college athletics everywhere is excess the faculty wishes to serve the manly sports for the good that theymaydorather than destroy them by overzeal the faculty would remind the sents that at the best athletics are and can be only secondary with us and that the faculty have already with contributions of money and fort carried more than their share of the burden they feel therefore that they have abundant right to ask the hearty cooperation of the signers of this petition in making our athletics such as will best help to build up our college in all ways the faculty would further remind the students that there are mary other athletic possibilities for those who take pleasure in outdoor sports and that the spirit of generous intercollegiate rivalry may well find material in contests in oratory and debating rather than risk concentrating our atteution upon a single debatable sport sicrned on behalf of the faculty b james reid president college exponent 13 golden rule store  we take this method of we have bought from d a murphy the golden rule store and will continue the business at the same stand and on the same business principles shoes slaughtered here are some record breakers the golden rule prices on these shoes have always been 25 per cent below all competition but in order to make room for our immense spring assortment we have c

the use of the graph from which the cut was made and also to thank mrs marshall and mr cobleigh of the college as to the arrangement of the picture we are also under obligations to the bozeman chronicle office for their help in ing our paper attractive in trading with our advertisers please mention the exponent they will appreciate it and so shall we the exponent has made an offer to students in the college to send this paper for the remainder of the school year for twentyfive cents we should like every student in the college on our list we think we should have them all many will wish to send the paper to their homes and the tion will make it possible to do so it will soon be spring antl the students should be planning and making arrangements for athletics of some kind they should bear in mind that football is not the only athletic sport that could well be carried on it is none too soon to be planning for field day as this has always been left until too late and sufficiert preparation was the result it was suggested last year that the athletic association give either a gold or silver medal to the winner in each of the contests and this could be done 2 college exponent if plans are made early enough there is also material in the college for a fairly good base ball nine and this is a spring game now that the faculty have thought best not to tinue football during the entire school year the students should take up some other game with as much thusiasm as they did football not many of our students seem to realize the value and importance of college literary societies more are eager for athletics they seem to think there is no necessity of learning to use language effectively that time spent in the elocution class is all wasted you frequently hear the mark i cant speak and whats the use of trying surely nothing will make one more acceptable in evey day life than knowing how to verse well the professional athlete is the center of attraction on field day but field day only comes casionally the good converser makes himself useful every day the literary societies offer valuable portunities to those who wish to vance their literary powers or over come their embarassment inspeaking writing essays is good pecially if the student is enough terested in his own welfare to do his own writing reading aloud which js too much neglected in college work is encouraged in the literary society the debate is the most beneficial of all the beginner first in his iasm for the contest overcomes his his embarassment and learns to pare his material with care and careful research he th us becomes acquainted with many books and also keeps an idea of current events knowing the progress of the world is one of the first requisites of a good and

bellows but instead have a fan run by the engine the shops are well equipped with good ery and almost any kind of machine ork can be done the assay office in the chemical building is almost completed and the students in asaying will start work a soon as the necessarv tools rive one interesting feture in nection with this buildinowill be the b meteorological in the north tower of the building here will be determined the direction and velocity of the wind the rain fall the temperature at all times the pheric pressure and the heat of the sun two books of local history two volumes on the history of bozeman have recently been lished which deserves notice in this paper the last of these published by the avant courier co of this city is a 26page pamphlet large size paper bound it is illustrated but none of the pictures are good the birds eye view of bozeman taken from the west taken in 1885 has some terest for present residents the historical section of the pamphet cupies eleven pages it appears to be a compilation from various authorities is interesting but disfigured by numerable misprints its historical accuracy we have no means of testing the remainder of the book is for advertising purposes the other volume was issued by the terian church of this city and contains the material gathered for the celebration of the twentyfifth versary of the church last may it is neatly bound in rough paper covers tied with colored cord and is illustrated with actual photographs  a large portion of the book can hardly be called historical and most of it is of interest chiefly to members of the church concerned there are many touches however that attract anyone who cares for manifestations of i hat indomitable pioneer spirit which has been so valuable a feature of our american life this interest is scattered throughout the volume but appears most in the letters from  4 college exponent bishop tuttle and rev mr richards and in mrs davis willsons account of the ladies aid society here are some genuine and finely drawn tures of a phase of life now passed away this volume is much more carefully edited than the other though there are occasional prints and it is a question whether some of the personalities well enough in the service of the church are not a little out of place in print this is certainly no serious offense however and it is only fair to say that the volume was not intended for general public circulation w f b st valentines day it came to pass in rome in the days of prince claudius that there dwelt a man there who had become known unto all men as one who was a leader of the sect as it was then esteemed of the christians now these ians you shall understand were very  troublesome unto the emperor who strove much with them whether or not they should give up their ways like to none other mens and worship after the common fashion the ors whom all men think to be after their death something near unto the gods and this is a great marvel but these emperors the christians would not bow down to nor worship them nor had they before the time of the prince claudius been blameless in the matter for even the good emperor aurelius antoninus had not been able to bend them to obedience to this law now more of this may be found out in the epistles of pliny but we speak rather of the troubles of the time of claudius and of this man saint valentine for all his neighbors thought him to be a wonder for his uprightness and for his kindness the claudius think mg 1t to be mischievous for such a man to be a leader of the christians sent and had him beheaded p0 claudius thought it wise to make such a man an example unto all who might be minded not to worship the emperor seeing that not even much love of people availed to save him but when his friends knew that this good saint was dead they remed him often and made it to be a tom among them and among their children to send to each other upon his birthday which fell upon the teenth day of the second month ters telling how much they esteemed the love of him who was gone and reminding one another of their mutual love and hope and from this it came about that upon this day this teenth of the second month the young men and maidens do still send to one another little tokens of love and ask one another to be their valentines meaning by this that they should be held in esteem as valentine was  
but there be some who do affirm that these messages are sent upon that day because upon that day the birds choose their mates as many wise men know right well wherein do not incline our minds to believe for then would this day be one for honest betrothal and promise of riage instead of mere idle loveing as is now the fashion and other wiser men say that all this custom came from the young men and maidens of france who would ask each one the other to be his gatin a word w herefrom the french have their word gallant meaning cover and then they 
say that the message was called from this a gale11tine or a valentine by these french and afterwards by others now in these latter opinions we do college exponent 5 d ise the reader to dwell for not a v  by be showeth much dlsrespect there  unto saint valentme that great and d nrnn who bath left so noble an aoo   ei ple of how good men should live exarn and die and to all young men and dens we counsel that they should rr1 themselves of foolish and silly and should think seriously f how they ought themselves to regood saint valentine and to love not vain shows and gaudy aparel but in truth and earnestness to p  h

is it to be attained the first article in this series the young man and the ministry by rev frank b lewis of the episcopal church in this place will be found on another page of this issue we are sure that our readers young men and others will be grateful to mr lewis for his words prepared at a time when he is much crowded with other work  later articles in this series already arranged for are by

addresses the fieldday records pictures of our  new buildings and such other material as may be found interesting such an issue would volve considerable extra expense and we could make it up only by greatly increased support from our patrons and those who should become our patrons we think we can count on this but we should be greatly couraged if any who think well of this plan would say a word to some member of the staff but do they after a vacant period it seems extremely natural that even stupid students should enjoy a lucid interval 2 college exponent the camera club exhibit w m cobleigh the third annual exhibit of the bozeman camera club was held in the academy building on friday ning february 11th over two hundred invited guests were present to examine the graphic progress made by the boze man amateurs during the past year the exhibit room was tastefully rated with college colors and the tures were artistically arranged on the walls the club now has fifty names on its membership roll only twentyfour members prepared specimens of their work for the exhibit while this shows deficient cooperation in the vast amount of work necessatyin paring for an exhibit yet out of a total of 670 pictures our own club furnished 548  our thanks are tended to the clubs of helena and missoula for their kindness in each submitting twentyone photographs and to various camera firms for ninety more lack of space will prevent a thorough and complete description of separate exhibits however mrs w m al ward deserves special mention for the originality shown in the jects selected mr

each exhibited some well taken river and mountain views of the east and west gallatin seventy per cent of the pictures were taken with the smaller hand cameras of the exhibitors under this class herman waters and stanley koch showed special ability not only in taking distant views with a small camera but in the finish of their tures as well mr hanlys collection labelled the rogues gallery was closely examined and was interesting to all the visitors to be honest1 however we must acknowledge that the photographs sent by the clubs at helena and msoula surpassed the work of the home amateurs aside from the excellent cloud effects obtained by the use of the ray filter the helena pictures were more artistic in the seletion and arrangement of the view and were better finished and mounted the liissoula pictures were equal to those from helena with the exception of the cloud effects the exhibits from these two clubs occupied a prominent place and were greatly admired by all the guests while we feel outdone yet it has given us a desire to keep improving our methods and we believe that we have learned much by a careful study of the pictures sent by our friend on tables in the center of the room was a display of sample copies of photographic papers and magazines and numerous catalogues of panies dealing in photographic ial the club is especially indebted to e and h t anthony  co of new

opportunities for improvement we should carefully study the proper selection of mounts for different pictures we hope our local dealers will watch the market closely and kep us supplied with

men looking for a life work i shall not hope to attract the attention of any who are not willing to look upon life as that whereby one can give thing instead of merely get thing generosity 1s characteristic of youth and i do not believe that it is the universal thought of the young when looking forward what shall i have for myself what is coming to me to those who will consider nothing else these few words will be folly perhaps the foremost thought in presenting such a matter is that here is a field that is not overcrowded while most of the liberal professions in these days are full to overflowing there is such need of men that the christian ministry offers to the right men properly equipped as fair a field as any in the whole oflife doubtless it is unnecessary to say this of all vocations should be approached most carefully most prayerfully for just as the church urges all to come into her membership and yet prefers none rather than the insincere and thy so though she needs young men in her ministry she would better leave the ranks unfilled than recruit the fit and the ill prepared he who aspires to be an officer in the christian army should be looking for victory for his troops and his captain ancl never for himself he is to be devoted therefore like those gallic soldiers of whom cresar tells us who had no terestno careno thoughtno lifeaside from him to whose friendship and companionship they had devoted themselves gives to these the name soldurii and some have suposed our word soldier to be derived 4 college exponent from that surely that should be the spirit with which those who propose to enter the christian ministry come soldiers devotion to the cause and to the leader not that they are to have an exaggerated notion of their own holiness to believe that they are specially beloved of god or better than their fellows far from that but they are to look upon life as an opportunity to be helpful to work not for self but for god and man to one who is willing to take such a view who has fair ahility gether with patience and opportunity to prepare himself the christian istry presents opportunities that not be rivalled not but a young man may and does often enter upon some other career of life with devout pose of doing much for good and for god and not designing to live for self but the contests areso keen tations are so great that many are turned from the purpose ere the active career is well begun more than in most other stations a clergyman is removed from the bitter strifes that so distract the attention from the main theme he is not so much drawn down by the temptations to strive for self in contests for worldly goods and worldly honors more  than elsewhere a fair and respectable living is assured and he is left free to pursue an ideal life in all channels of unselfish usefulness that are open to men if then a preparation for the try is not to be considered an ment that yields return in kind how muchshould be put into it i answer that the cause requires the best paration that can be obtained and the more because the returns are to go to others and not to self it is as true here as in any other work as cicero has it natural ability without culture is better than culture without natural ability but as in the old romans days so now the best sults will be br combining the highest natural abilities with the best culture possible sometimes the sing need for men urges those with good qualifications to hurry to the work sometimes one with few portunities for education believes self fitted to do good work as a sionary or a preacher in exceptional cases he could not wait for the ing but most such exceptions will not be young men those who have done good work halffitted could have done better work with more otunity or more patience even the master waited thirty years we may believe for preparation before he gan his active ministry this is an example to those who are inclined to hurry to the work because they see the need he knew the misery that relief the ignorance that ed instruction the sin that needed reproof however great the need the work must wait until the workman is prepared the church needs men but she needs disciplined men well equipped men men who shall be peers in literary culture of those in any other socalled learned profession theology is queen of the sciences those who assume to be her subjects cannot afford to be inferior in the learning of the to the votaries of any other science the training and discipline of preparatoiy school university and seminary should be sought then by the young man aiing at the ministry and when he has completed these courses he will be able to feel that he has not attempted to give before he had anything worth giving but such a course requires nine or ten years of exclusive study during college exponent 5 hich the business man and he who v  r  has taken a short cut mto a pro1ess10n are laying foundations of success and fortune are there successes to be made in the ministry sufficient to tify such expense of time money to him who counts success m worldly wealth and worldly honors plainly no but to him who sees success in duty done and in doing it just as certainly yes it is wealth and honor to be privileged to exhibit gods love the only foundation of mans love to god or man it is wealth and honor to possess the love and confidence which is given in such generous ure to those who do this work for christ a clergyman sets out to do gods work to build and to care for gods church but he goes about this work with the knowledge that the church will be built will grow with his aid if he give it without if he withhold it the successes then are not for self but for god for christ for his church and for fellowman true there are the successes of high salaries and honorable positions but they are not to be mentioned in parison with the other they may be aspired to because they bring greater opportunities or because one knows himself capable of doing the larger work if sought for their own sake they will generally be missed as they ought to be they can come but to the few and in theministrymorethan elsewhere the place should seek the man not the man the place sometimes i know the disgraceful machinery of the caucus is brought into the church and wirepulling electioneering and political tion are used to attain place and pelf they may succeed in bringing about the temporal end desired but such ends are not the real successes of the ministry and when they appear most brilliant they are very probably the most egregious failures these real successes are to be reached by ily doing duty not by demagogism not by selfseeking but by working like the devoted soldiers for the cess of the cause for the glory of the captain so this work offers a real certainty of success in life what schemes may not fail what ral lifework may not be done amiss but god cannot fail his church shall stand hence faithful work for him must succeed whether it wins the worlds plaudits or like the masters seem to result in disgrace and shame frank b lewis  where the marigolds grew oh for the longing for sweet voice singing a sweet

note of sadness in the voice that replied yes i used to reason with the old chimney every time it was old you know and smoking is such a comfort to old folks but youll be troubled no more in that way this last was spoken sorrowfully and at first i thought the old academy was ing but i observed that a rain shower was in progress without and that i had wandered on into what used to be called the art department i could almost feel the look of proach it cast upon me as i gazed upward to the ceiling where a wet spot plainly showed i hastily changed the subject and pointed to a pile of bricks near where the stove used to stand the girls heated them on top of the stove and used them as footwarmers on cold ter days you remember yes i remembered only too well and also thought of the hole in the northwest corner of the floor so convenient to  college exponent t ff useless bits into i sat near it s u
