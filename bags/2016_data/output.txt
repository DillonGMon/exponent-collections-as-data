with the goal of making the library bet
ter for all visitors remodeling projects have 
begun on the north section and lobby of 

the msu librarys third oor e remodels 

focus on making the library the most con
ducive learning area possible e remodel 

includes carpeting the north study space 

adding study tables and chairs rewiring the 

space tiling the lobby adding a new water 

bottle dispenser and painting
e north wing of the third oor which 
looks out toward montana hall previously 

was home to a collection of maps held in 

metal cabinets last january and february 

the maps were relocated to the fourth oor 

for the time before the remodeling began 

study carrels which are the closed in desks 

were moved into the space to provide extra 

study room
the study carrels were temporarily 
put in the space and have now been moved 

out so that new carpet can be installed 

under this new carpet a new wiring con
figuration will be installed that will allow 

for power stations at every table the wir
ing which runs under the carpet is a new 

technology called the steelcase thread 

system normally new wiring would re
quire drilling through the floor but this 

system allows for the wiring to run under 

the carpet making it possible to move
technology has brought many 
changes that the library has to keep up 

with having power stations at tables 

has almost become a necessity but only a 

few years ago was not an inconvenience 

kris johnson is the head of learning and 
research services at the library and part 
of the library spaces and technology 

renovation committee which heads 
the project johnson says that one of cur
rent goals of the library is to be prepared 

for the rapid changes that have come 

about with technology this is a trend 

that is nationwide right now which is li

brary spaces and making them more con
ducive for learning in the 21st century 

johnson said  
e study tables were chosen over closed 
o study carrels based on the principle that 

some students study better in quiet areas alone 

together e study area will be similar to the 

second oor but the tables and chairs will be 

upgraded comfortable chairs will also be 

placed facing the large glass windows that face 

montana hall e windows facing the mall 

were partially covered in 

the past in order to con
serve energy and part 

of the current remod
eling project includes 

looking into reopening 

these windows to allow 

for more light into the 

north study area 
kenning arlitsch 
dean of the library says 

that one of the main 

reason for this remod
eling project as well 

as others is increased 

visitation from students 

is makes creating 

comfortable spaces even 

more important as more 

room is needed for students nationally librar
ies are implementing new techniques to create 

the best possible spaces for students and ar
litsch emphasizes that the renovation projects 

in msus library follow this trend is is an 

ongoing eort to improve the spaces in the li

brary arlitsch said 
e lobby of the third oor and entrance 
to the north area has also undergone a change 

e wall and doors were taken out and a glass 

wall like the one on the opposite side going 

into the fountain area has been installed e 

area surrounding the drinking fountain is being 

tiled painted and new water fountain which 

will also ll water bottles with ltered water is 
being added due to 

complaints that the 

doors going into the 

fountain area were 

too loud new more 

quiet doors were also 

installed on that side 

of the third oor
creating better 
learning areas for stu
dents and visitors of the 

library means keeping 

up with new trends 

and also listening to 

students which the li

brary focuses on we 

do watch whats going 

on nationally and we 

try to keep up and this 
project is an example of that johnson said
in the future the library plans to hire 
an architect rm to map out the building 

as an overall space pick out areas that need 

improvement and then as funding allows 

continue remodeling projects to improve the 

library as a whole

blackstone is open and accessible to all 

students at msu who have innovative and 

practical ideas for inventing or improving 
technology business models and the world

fice to be a home for business students 

but also for the whole campus aytes ex
plained which is why we put the col
laboration lab right next to it
with an inviting yet industrial look 
the collaboration lab is a entanglement 

of chairs tables whiteboards and desks 

all of the furnishings in the room were on 

wheels because this room full of organized 

chaos was intended to be just that
the chairs are different from the rest 
of the rooms and we put everything on 

wheels so that students could come in here 

and work on a project said aytes we 

want engineers artists biologists chem
ists and everyone else in here working to
gether thats what this is all about
according to aytes there are a num
ber of breakout rooms and study spaces 

that are open for people to come in and 

work there are many areas that were de
signed to facilitate collaboration but 

there are also a good number of places for 

individual studying
as the sky cleared a bit outside aytes 
gestured into one of the classrooms in
side there was a man with a laptop head
phones and papers scattered about the ta
ble he seemed to be deeply concentrated 

on his work

paramount issue of student debt 

advocating for aordable housing or 
registering rsttime voters forward montana 

empowers young people to become agents of 

change in their community forward montana 

trains mobilizes and elects young people so we 

may have a clear and powerful voice in 

montana as a prospective or current 

student at msu right now you have 

the incredible opportunity to take 

action become civically engaged and 

better bozeman  forward montana 

will help you make it happen 
in 2004 when a group of college 
students in missoula recognized that 

montanas political system had become 

too exclusive they founded forward 

montana while were in college exercising our 

right to vote arguably the most important civic 

right can be incredibly challenging 
youth voters 
too oen face problems during the democratic 

process such as keeping their voting addresses 

current and getting to the polls on election day 
ese determined students created 
forward montana  an organization that 

has since been instrumental in the passage 

of multiple tuition freezes graduated over 

150 interns and registered tens of thousands 

of voters in 2014 alone forward montana 

collected over 3000 signatures in support of 
the bozeman nondiscrimination 

ordinance a city measure protecting 
gay and trans residents and 

registered over 10000 voters
forward montana may be 
most easily identied by volunteers 

wearing bunny ears e programs 

progressive culture has wide support 

from msus student body for 

msu senior 
elias horat forward 
montana has reached out to inform 
students such as myself on issues in local state 

and national government 
he continued adding that forward 
montana has been successful at creating 

an exciting learning environment that not 

only helps you learn about government but 
actually makes you excited and wanting to 

be involved in the future of our community 

state and even nation
for the 201516 academic year forward 
montana has even bigger projects in motion 

primarily forward montana is implementing 
the 
youth agenda 
project according to 
bozeman director kiah abbey e 
youth 
agenda 
project 
yap  reconnects young people 
to their power in our democracy e goal of the 

yap is to create a clear understanding of what 
political and social issues young montanans care 

about is large undertaking will be executed 

through surveying and will in turn guide 

forward montanas operations 
e message of this project is clear abbey 
added that 
policy shouldnt be decided by only 
older people in suits we need to stand as 50000 

students strong and demand access to wilderness 

areas workplace protections for the lgbtq 

community and student debt reform
forward montanas civic power lies not 
only in their political organization eorts 

but also in their ability to involve youth 
roughout the year their are numerous 

volunteer opportunities including registering 

voters and canvassing for those seeking long 

term involvement forward montana operates 

a well developed internship program
forward montana partners with the 
department of 
political science to oer 
three upper division credits for a grassroots 

organizing internship is popular program 

directly connects students to campaigns and 

community issues while providing real world 

work experience 
for those who cannot yet vote there is a 
robust program for high school students the 

underage democracy internship
with around four surprisingly short 
years at msu our time to make an impact 

is limited forward montana enables 

students to discover the grassroots organizer

political community
fraternities faced national media 

attention with a recent spotlight on 

negative activity this past march 
when the video was discovered on march 

7 of this year the racist chant sung by 

members of the university of 
oklahomas 

sigma alpha 
epsilon chapter was 
met with public outrage that led 

to the house being suspended from 

the campus within the same week 

the 
pi kappa alpha chapter at the 

university of connecticut was 

suspended for charges including 

illegal use of alcohol and the 

university of houstons chapter 

of sigma chi was suspended for 

hazing seemingly motivated by incidents 

such as these that breed the destructive 

culture plaguing fraternities this year and of 

the rape allegations from the last academic 

year at msu the chapters at montana 

state are establishing new precautions to 

counteract this problem 
montana state university and 
the parties within it have progressed in 

establishing new bodies to enforce the rules 

of our school at the houses of fraternities 

new enforcers provided by the fraternities 

themselves include the interfraternity 

safety team and sexual violence prevention 

training provided by the msu v
oic
e center both the university and the greeks 

worked together on december 20 2013 by 
banning all alcohol except for wine and beer 

at all future gatherings of 
pi kappa alpha 

and sigma chi due to the rape allegations 

against those fraternities during the week of 

september 17 of that year however rather 

than focusing solely on adding policies and 
new groups to impose those rules 

an emphasis must also be placed 

on changing fraternities internally
most if not all fraternities are 
founded upon ideals that intend to 

rene young men into respectful 

responsible and successful leaders 

outside of college involvement 

with outside resources to 

improve their chapter as a whole 
is necessary but the individual members 

themselves must fulll their responsibility 

to their brothers for the brotherhood to 

succeed all members need to be attentive 

and responsible in keeping each other in 

check with both their behavior as well as 

their fraternitys moral code by staying true 

to the purpose of their respective fraternity 

the temptations that lead to such tragic 

moments as rape racism and illegal use 

of alcohol should be easier to push aside 

because of a more positive culture
 by forming a positive community 
such negative actions that seem to be 

commonplace can be become a rarity  

especially if the public is involved too by 

responding correctly to incidents the public 
act as watchdogs to keep fraternities in line 

but we cannot react blindly or rashly until 

the facts are conrmed because that would 

cause even more trouble 
in 2014 at the university of virginia 
the 
phi kappa 
psi chapter was accused of 
gang raping a student in response the public 

was outraged and by constantly pressuring 

the president of the university all greek 

houses and organizations were expelled 

from the campus without any support from 

an investigationwhile the charges were 

found to be unfounded and later dropped 

all parties reputations remained damaged 

and at the cost of blind action 
e public should have waited for the 
investigation to conclude then it would be 

clearer if the fraternity was guilty and would 

create more time for the universitys president 

to handle the situation justly and accordingly 

e public has the power to change and if 

used incorrectly the community will suer 

by the publics pressure the president of the 

school was motivated to suspend all greek 

organizations when only one was in question 

which essentially made that universitys 

culture antigreek erefore how can we 

expect fraternities to change when even 

those innocent of accusations are closed by 

public demands
to create the positive culture needed to 
end such incidents happening in fraternities 

all parties must be involved fraternity 
members need to keep each other in line with 

their organizations message that intends for 

them to be great men in the working world 

upon news of events such as sexual assault 

or illegal alcohol incidents at fraternities 

montana state must follow through with a 

solid investigation then respond accordingly 

with their ndings and not because of 

public pressure e public must not react 

blindly and with prejudice instead we must 

encourage positive actions by fraternities 

and act upon facts not suspicion to x such 

problems requires a community willing to 

listen and be just when problems arise not 

one where blame is placed without backing 

and prejudices divide parties within

go to the ask us desk with questions 
when i first arrived at msu i 
thought the ask us desk was 

just a worthless information 
booth for visitors that also sold tickets 

to concerts actually the ask 

us desk can almost be seen 

as a concierge service for all 

students go there with any 

question or with anything that 

might be needed and the ask 

us desk will be happy to do it 

or at least explain how the best 

part its all free
in a time of the internet 
one would hardly think an 

actual human being answering questions 

easily solved by google is an appropriate 

use of asmsu funds i myself have 

wondered the same question why would 

one pay someone to compete with the 

internet 
plus unlike google one has to 
be wearing pants to use the ask us desk 

so its a real shocker that they are still 

operating as it turns out the sacrifice 

of leaving home to visit the ask us desk 

is worth it they do way more than be 

the universitys google and they are 

also the face of our university they 

are the students first point of contact 

if they need anything forgot where 

that meeting was in the sub just 

ask them want to know how to get a 

meeting with 
president cruzado away 
to the ask us desk you go left your 

chemistry flash cards on top of your 

car and drove away to let them flutter 

about in the parking lot chances are 

someone picked them up and they are 

now at the ask us desk side note ive 

done that before the picking up of the 

cards that is
lets say youre the proud president of 
your new club unaware students and 

as if to prove a point you have no idea 

how to reserve the ballrooms for your 
convention on learning the detectable 

outrageous 
roundtable kinesthetic 
or if you can even reserve the 

ballrooms instead of sending emails 
to random people hoping you 

can find the right person all 

you have to do is go to the ask 

us desk and they will help 

you reserve the rooms
lets say you are a 
responsible citizen and you are 

trying to vote by absentee ballot 

in your home state the ask us 

desk can fax that ballot for less 

than a dollar and you dont even 
have to leave campus
lets say you are selling your 
longboard because its time people took 

you seriously the ask us desk has an 

advertising board no a corkposter 

board where you can advertise the sale 

for only fifty cents
lets say you just bought a longboard 
from one of those 3by5 cards in the 

sub and the previous owner was not 

very responsible about upkeep the ask 

us desk can point you to a good board 

shop in town and even directions on how 

to get there
the ask us desk is just all around 
the goto place for help for example 

once i needed to get the keys to my 

roommates car 
our schedules were 
such that there was no time to meet 

up and exchange keys my roomate 

left them at the ask us desk with 

my name and i was able to pick them 

up later sure limitation exist for 

instance one would actually have to 

talk to someone and the ask us desks 

brick and mortar business plan means 

they cant be accessed from the comfort 

of a personal computer but i think it is 

worthwhile to look past all of that and 

just go use the ask us desk

music on main will kick off its 15th 
year on june 25 when the bozeman

born group 
the clintons will play an 
hourandahalf set from a stage at the heart 

of downtown 
every 
thursday until mid
august another group will take the stage 
from 7 to 830 pm to play for thousands of 

merrymakers as they enjoy the evening sun 

food offerings from local restaurants and the 

blockparty atmosphere
like many evening gatherings of friends 
as the sun fades and the music plays the 

drinks will flow with crowds numbering in 

the thousands and profits fluctuating how
ever some residents and businesses believe 

the event has gotten out of hand
the back story
music on main began in 2000 tucked 

away in an alley 
attendance was low 

in the beginning  often only a few 
dozen people attended  but the potential 

for growth was clear when the downtown 

bozeman 
association db
a started man
aging the event the next year it was moved 

to south bozeman 
avenue and continued 
to grow 
attendance started to multiply 
expanding from tens of people to multiple 

hundreds in 2007 with crowds estimated to 

reach as many as 2000 the annual event was 

moved to its current home squarely in the 

center of downtown between 
rouse 
avenue 
and black 
avenue 
the event is now impor
tant enough to shut down main street 
ellie staley the program director of the 
db
a is in charge of choosing the bands to 
play every year 
after bands register on the 
db
as website for consideration she and the 
db
a board of directors made up of eight 
downtown business owners listen to samples 

of the applicants to select promising acts
staley also draws on her past working 
relationships to find good acts for music on 
main i have great relationships with book
ing agents and band managers  ive worked 

for downtown for ten years she said so if i 

develop a good relationship with a band and 

i think they do a good job and their represen
tation is nice to work with ill reach out to 

see what other bands they represent
while many of the musicians are boz
eman favorites  this years lineup begins 

with 
the clintons and ends with cure for 
the common  music on main comple
ments its lineup with acts from around mon
tana and the country 
randy mc
allister a 
texasbased singersongwriter will be per
forming on july 2 and 
the bus driver 
tour 
performing july 16 divides its time between 

livingston and knoxville 
tennessee oth
er acts this year fall include jameson and the 

sordid seeds from whitefish and john 
rob
erts a music professor at ms
ubillings
more than music
the event is not just a quiet concert 

however 
ron gompertz the owner 
of wild joes coffee spot described 
music on main not as a concert which sold 

alcohol but as alcoholcentric with music 

and one big bar 
this stems from the citys open con
tainer waiver for music on main which 

suspends the usual ban on any open con
tainers of alcohol 
according to the boz
eman code of ordinances it is unlaw
ful for any person to engage in public 

drinking public display or exhibition of 

open alcoholic beverages open container 

within the city limits violation of this 

ordinance is a misdemeanor which can 

result in a 100500 fine and up to six 

months in jail 
the court can also order 
anyone convicted to pay the costs of 

prosecution or imprisonment or both as 

part of the sentence
gompertz became the public face of 
opposition to music on main last year when 

he approached the downtown bozeman 
association with his concerns about the open 

container waiver he believes the event has 

become more focused on alcohol and a bigger 

party with every passing year and that this 

is getting away from the initial spirit of the 

event he worries that it is too easy for un
derage drinkers to acquire alcohol that the 

event is contributing to drunk driving and 

that public drunkenness 

is pushing away some po
tential attendees 
we dont see the 
families we dont see the 

kids anymore gom
pertz said he is consid
ering closing wild joes 

early this summer during 

music on main days to 

avoid the issues which 

include drunken pa
trons people urinating 

on lawns and decreased 

business he believes a 

majority of his business 

neighbors feel similarly
staley disagrees i think we take mas
sive precautions she said were pretty on 

it when it comes to security working with 

the police department and just recognizing 

that with growth and bigger crowds comes 

the potential for bigger issues
this is not the first time concerns over 
music on main and the consequences of pub
lic drinking have been raised in response to 

complaints from homeowners in the areas 

surrounding music on main in 2011 the 

bozeman police department gathered city 

representatives sponsors and event bever
age servers for a meeting seeking to secure 

funding for additional officers in the hours 

following music on main
the businesses agreed to fund addi
tional patrols splitting the approximately 
4000 annual costs between the after

hours establishments businesses open be
tween 10 pm and 2 am 
in 2014 in response to gompertz and 
others concerns the db
a sent a survey to its 
members city commissioners other city rep
resentatives and event sponsors 
according to 

the survey more than 50 percent of businesses 

reported their sales were either average or bet
ter than average on music on main nights 

while only 15 percent believed the event hurt 
their business 
one in ten respon
dents however reported 

chronic and unusual 

issues they believed to 

be related to music on 

main events
gompertz said he 
believes many businesses 

do not wish to speak out 

publicly on such a con
troversial issue and risk 

either making enemies 

with other businesses or 

potentially alienating 

customers that enjoy the 

event only 24 percent of 
the db
as polls were completed and returned
currently the db
a has no further 
plans to address alcoholrelated issues at 

music on main
alcohol aside gompertz was quick 
to stress that he never wanted to have the 

event cancelled entirely we love music 

on main we love music he said but add
ed that we would like to see the drinking 

done more responsibly

tion into the hearts of both viewers and 

competitorsthis competition makes 

football rodeo wrestling and rugby look 

like football rodeo wrestling and rugby 

i am speaking about the scripps national 

spelling bee
on may 29 the national spelling bee 
ended in a tie between gokul benkatacha
lam and vanya shivashankar who finished 

with the words scherenschnitte and 

nunatak respectively words like these 

remind me that im just below the recom
mended reading level for twilight 
ive always admired the kids who excel 
in this competition these are young brai

niacs who can spell cymotrichous using 

only the words language of origin part of 

speech and their skill from hours of recep
tive spelling i sometimes forget when to 

use q instead of g in quest 
when i was in eighth grade i was 
lucky enough to take part in montanas 

state spelling bee lucky in that half of the 

participants from my countys spelling bee 

didnt care and that the other half got words 

that were much trickier than mine i won 

the county bee with the word 
olympian 
i think the second place opponent had to 

spell 
pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism
i got to the state spelling bee to dis
cover im in seat 63 out of 66 allowing me 
ample vtime to tremble in fear before my 

turn the ceremony began amicably as last 

years champion who was also participat
ing delivered a friendly speech in which 

he reminded us 
you are all winners 
personally i thought he was really saying 
you are all going to be losers im going 
to crush yall and celebrate in my extrava
gant hot tub surrounded by my gorgeous 

girlfriends while you fools cry and contem
plate your academic inadequacies 
eighth 
grade spelling geniuses are notorious jocks   
the powers that be decided we would 
have a practice round which with 66 of us 

took roughly one hour 
eventually i took 
the stage i looked out and saw my smil
ing family the press and the spelling bee 

announcer who was atop a lake of hellfire 

surrounded by her legion of satanic angels 

i may have been imagining this last part
when i got to the microphone for 
my practice round word and the an
nouncer looked at me and said knowl
edge whew an easy word clearly there 

was no way i could mess this up i just had 

to remember you cannot change how you 

spelled a word once you started i looked 

confidently at the lady and her sharpened 

red trident and started
n

my grandmother immediately gasped 
and in doing so managed to swallow all of 

the oxygen in the gym which caused the 
rest of the audience to suffocate and starve 

for air all of us were writhing on the 

ground when someone managed to open 

the gymnasium door and let the oxygen 

back in 
of course i may be imagining the 

last two thirds of that part as the oxygen 

had left my brain
i took my seat awash in selfrecrimi
nation it didnt help that the simple word 

i so spectacularly botched is a word that 

literally says in the dictionary facts in
formation  or stuff you need to know to 

be smart but apparently you are not smart 

william hamel 
your ancestors must 
be ashamed suffer fool  however i re
bounded well by correctly spelling civics 

making my way to the second round
as i waited for my next turn a con
testant roughly 20 spots ahead of me mis

spelled the word camelot immediately 

i began to sing monty 
pythons knights 
of the 
roundtable underneath my breath 
this must have been peculiar to the small 

petite fifth grade girl beside me who was 

probably asking herself why is the ugly 

boy humming and who is clark gable
i approached for my second turn the 
announcer went carrion immediately 

i said to myself curses graham chap
man  why couldnt you have a humor
ous song with the word carrion i was 

doomed and misspelled the word ending 

my quest at the second question luckily 
the 
pit of 
eternal 
peril wasnt taking new 
occupants seriously just google these 

obscure references
the lesson to be learned here is 
uh um put spelling bee words in songs 

so impressionable eighth graders can re
member them i will never forgive monty 

python for refusing to use the following 
lyrics we dine well here in camelot we 

eat ham and jam and spam a lot and car
rion upon occasion
actually the real lesson here is to 
study hard and always try because if you 

practice hard in whatever you endeavor 

you can avoid massive public embarrass

 nor
man
june is here and that means one of the 
biggest gaming events of the year 
e3 news 
and rumors abound as to what kind of content 

is going to be shown by various companies at 

the 
electronic 
entertainment 
expo but one 
announcement in particular has gamers very 

interested bethesda studios the creators of the 

very popular fallout and e 
elder scrolls 
series has stated that theyre going to rerelease 

doom doom guys its coming back
originally developed by id soware 
which is now owned by bethesdas parent 

company zenimax media though it wasnt 

at the time of dooms production in 1993 

doom is considered by many in the gaming 

industry to be responsible for the enormous 

popularity of the rstperson shooter genre 

at its release the game had some of the best 

most innovative 3d graphics yet seen it also 

is credited with pioneering the concept of 
multiplayer games played over a network 

rather than by players who were together in the 

same room besides that doom was one of 

the rst games to feature an anonymous space 

marine character a trope furthered by games 

like halo and mass 
eect decades later
as of last december an average of 
100 players per night could be found still 

playing the original doom online why 

why bother playing a game that seems so 

primitive by todays standards and why if 

people are still playing the original would 

bethesda bother to remake it well on 

the one hand people love nostalgia a lot 

of players today grew up with games like 

doom and replaying it brings back great 

memories of happy childhoods spent hud
dled in front of a massive desktop click
ing merrily away to kill hordes of demonic 

invaders 
remembering and reliving e 
good 
old days is a very powerful motiva
tor psychologically speaking 
even if your rosetinted glasses fall o aer 
youve started playing your favorite game again 

aer tracking down a version of the game that 

doesnt involve reconguring your entire com
puter your memories of the days your mom 

would say that you wasted slaving away at a hot 

keyboard grinding through level aer level bring 

back feelings of satisfaction selfregard and in
terestingly a connection to other people even if 

you never played multiplayer
however as much as people love nostalgia 
they also love the good graphics and higherend 

computing power of todays gaming bethesdas 

rerelease of doom is going to be for the xbox 

one and the 
playstation 4 as well as on 
pc 
which means an exponentially more rened 

gaming experience than developers in the mid

1990s could have ever dreamed e brief game
play preview that bethesda released on may 18 

showed just how much work the development 

team put into updating the graphics engines 

one of the developers tiago sousa worked 
extensively on games like far cry and crysis 

both of which were lauded for their astounding 

graphics before joining bethesdas team
bethesda games are famous for their mod
friendliness mods are playerproduced edits to 

games that either augment or replace les lines 

of code and textures within the game itself and 

bethesda oen encourages players to mod by re
leasing their development les doom was one 

of the rst games to seriously acknowledge the 

capacity of its players to create their own content 

and it therefore became a groundbreaker for the 

modding community before such a commu
nity even existed its tting then that bethesda 

would choose a game like doom to put their 

name on and with the internet fostering a big
ger modding community than ever its tting 

too that they would choose now to rerelease it
a full gameplay reveal is scheduled dur
ing bethesda studios press conference on the 

evening of june 14 during 
e3 which will be 

livestreamed by ign on their website

roll the dough into a ball and flat
ten it out on a pizza pan or a cookie

legacy and purpose were 
recurring themes at the 2015 
freshman convocation on 
wednesday aug 26 nearly 4000 
students and community members 
took their seats in the brick breeden 
fieldhouse to listen to a collection 
of accomplished women dole out a 
handful of inspiring life lessons
convocation was conceived 
as a means to get students rooted 
at msu said david singel chair 
of the convocation committee and 
associate provost we learn in a 
memorable way about the value of 
education and about the importance 
of resilience and grit in those pursing 
it it is also a great opportunity for 
the whole community  to show 
their support for our new class
he and the rest of the 
committee composed of nearly 30 
members of the msu community 
have a base budget of 50000 but 
can supplement that with additional 
funds for special events is years 
convocation costs are still being 
calculated and wont be released 
until the end of the month but 
singel estimated the total cost 
would be around 70000 carmen 
mcspadden director of the msu 
leadership institute said that the 
speakers contracts came to 34000 
including travel expenses
singel said that the convocation 
committee believes convocation 
is worth the cost because it helps 
advance critical msu objectives 
of student persistence and degree 
completion singel added extensive 
studies  support the notion that 
building bonds with entering students 
through events like convocation 
increases student retention
making the decision to attend 
msu is the rst step to leaving your 
legacy asmsu president gwynn 
simeniuk said in her opening 
speech students at msu from 
every background and academic 
discipline are changing the world 
around them right now ey have 
done this by becoming engaged 
and owning it  by joining clubs 
on campus volunteering in the 
community  they are the leaders of 
tomorrow who have begun leaving 
their legacy today
president cruzado spoke 
following simeniuk emphasizing 
that the path to success is oen lined 
with mistakes
you might think that your 
future holds a career in engineering 
only to fall in love with contempo
rary chinese literature cruzado 
told students do not be afraid to 
experience new things even at the 
risk of failing
i really liked when the 
president was speaking freshman 
trenton steach said aer convoca
tion a lot of people dont realize 
that they have a lot of potential 
because they come from situations 
where they cant see it but like she 
said at this university its your 
chance to write your own story
e themes of legacy and 
potential culminated with keynote 
speaker rebecca skloot author of 
e immortal life of henrietta 
lacks skloot an awardwinning 
nonction writer spent 11 years 
researching the novel which details 
the life and strange immortality 
of henrietta lacks an african
american woman lacks was 
diagnosed with cervical cancer in 
1951 while receiving treatment she 
unknowingly had part of her cervix 
removed e cells from her cervix 
were used to create an immortal 
cell line  known as hela cells  
which have been used to aid medical 
discoveries all around the world 
lacks died a short while aer her 
cells were harvested never knowing 
the contribution she unwittingly 
made to the world
skloot became obsessed with 
discovering the truth of henrietta 
lacks in high school but the road to 
becoming a published novelist wasnt 
easy originally attending college 
to become a veterinarian skloot 
didnt realize her passion for writing 
until her senior year of college due 
to what she described as tunnel 
vision  an aiction which many 
college students are familiar with 
 she rarely seriously appreciated

msus department of 
education received notice on aug 
26 that the northwest accrediting 
council granted accreditation to 
their new phd program previously 
doctoral students could pursue a 
doctorate of education edd 
which focuses on the practical applica
tion of theory and research in the eld 
of education e new doctorate of 
philosophy phd program focuses 
on developing researchers and people 
who will be analyzing and working in 
policymaking situations in the eld 
of education
 ese apparently similar 
programs actually serve two specic 
and unique purposes  as dr ann 
dutton ewbank assistant professor 
of education and the program leader 
for curriculum and instruction 
explained e doctorate of 
philosophy is going to help people 
to tackle brand new problems and 
issues and generate new knowledge 
for the eld and advance the eld 
of education whereas the edd is 
more about looking at problems of 
practical importance
 dr tricia seifert associate 
professor and program leader of adult 
and higher education emphasized 
this as well if your career goal and 
objective is to really work in discovery 
and research inquiry then the phd 
is a very appropriate degree path if 
your interest is in bringing thoughtful 
research based theoretically informed 
knowledge to practice based settings 
in a classroom in a school in a district 
or board then the edd would be an 
appropriate career degree stream
additional benets also come 
with the new program which will 
help to maintain msus status as a 
highly intensive research university 
as phd students at msu oen serve 
as research assistants and initiate their 
own original research
 ese students also oer benets 
to undergraduate students eres a 
benet to our undergraduates as well 
because many of these phd students 
are going to become graduate teaching 
assistants and theyre going to be 
teaching undergraduate level courses in 
education ewbank said ey bring a 
wealth of experience and knowledge to 
those positions that they can translate 
to the undergraduate classroom
 ose who choose to pursue 
a phd in education must have a 
masters degree in education or a related 
eld e rst part of the program 
involves coursework and upon passing 
a comprehensive exam students enter 
the dissertation phase e time 
it takes to complete this program 
depends on many factors but students 
can spend a maximum of ten years 
completing it
 having received notice of 
accreditation the department of 
education is ready to admit students 
into the phd program and all of 
msu can look forward to the benets 
that will come with the addition 
of another exciting educational 
opportunity  
is is the rst phd program 
for education in the state and oers 
many benets for both msu as 
well as montana previously those 
who wished to pursue a phd in 
education had to leave the state some 
of those people may have returned to 
montana taking away the benets 
that come from having educators 
with a phd level education
msu begins oering doctoral program in education
theres a benet to our undergraduates as well because many 
of these phd students are going to become graduate teaching 
assistants and theyre going to be teaching undergraduate level 
courses in education

statement from gwynn 
simeniuk
dear students of montana state university
as your asmsu president i made a commitment last 
spring to serve you by acting at all times in the best 
interests of the student body and to do nothing which 
violated the trust you gave me when you elected me 
to this office my recent actions have not upheld this 
commitment and i want to share the following with 
all of you i deeply regret to inform you that on the 
weekend of august 15th i was charged with a dui 
driving under the influence of alcohol i am truly 
sorry to you the student body i have let you down 
i realize that my actions reflect upon the students 
and the university as a whole i fully recognize the 
severity of my actions and am ashamed that i have 
exercised such poor judgement i am currently having 
conversations with our dean of students about the 
student code of conduct process am working with my 
attorney through the legal process and am accessing 
support services at the university to assure that i do 
not repeat this mistake however i know that this 
does not change my irresponsibility and i understand 
that many of you will be disappointed in me and 
rightly so 
many students may feel that they cannot trust me i 
understand that and will work every day to earn back 
that trust i want to follow through on the commitment 
i made this past spring to serve the student body 
as your asmsu president i believe that i can still 
be a voice for our students but i know that i cannot 
effectively represent the students who elected me 
without your support and trust in the coming weeks 
i would like to hear your questions thoughts and 
concerns regarding this issue
in all sincerity

opinion
weve heard time 
and again to 
get out and 
volunteer better yourself 
by bettering others and go 
change the world  all those 
cliches
  however when youre out volun
teering its easy to feel like you 
cant actually make a dierence or 
that one person cant change the 
world i believe otherwise 
i spent a month of this past 
summer in ailand half of 
that time was spent volunteering 
at an elephant sanctuary e 
treatment of elephants in asia 
can be terrible street performers 
buy elephants as young as a 
year old and cart them around 
bustling hot cities like bangkok 
performing tricks and begging on 
the streets trekking camps oer 
rides to tourists on platform seats 
that can severely injure anatten 
an elephants back logging is 
outlawed in ailand but when 
the authorities turn 
their heads nothing 
stops companies from 
overworking elephants 
in harsh conditions 
forcing them to pull 
loads of trees up steep 
hills
e time i put in 
at elephantsworld 
a sort of retirement 
home for these elephants who 
have been rescued from abusive 
situations was mostly spent doing 
what could seem like small tasks 
cutting fruit for the elephants 
planting a eld of bana grass to be 
harvested as food later building 
a concrete wall helping bathe 
the elephants and so on when 
thinking in the grand scheme of 
things it was easy to feel like i 
was doing nothing to help x the 
conditions of elephants globally 
or even nationwide in ailand 
all these tasks we were doing were 
helpful but were they 
more benecial for us 
as a travel experience 
than they were for the 
elephants
it turns out even 
these seemingly small 
tasks add up any volun
teer eort is worthwhile 
at elephantsworld our 
time spent washing and 
cutting fruit allowed the mahouts 
elephant caretakers more time 
to spend caring for their elephants 
and bonding with them once 
harvested the eld of bana grass 
we planted will feed the elephants 
for up to 4 years e concrete 
wall we spent hours sweating 
over will allow the elephants to 
spend less time chained up and 
more time roaming free when 
the elephants are not chained up 
they sometimes wander into the 
neighboring farmland to snack  a 
habit that can be costly as they 
have to pay for eaten crops our 
time spent bathing the elephants 
in the river allowed me to create 
bonds with these incredible 
intelligent animals is bond has 
inspired a sense of urgency and 
activism in me urging me to help 
make a dierence in how they are 
treated
it all adds up all it takes is 
someone to speak up and take 
action if you are passionate 
about something get involved 
and volunteer help a cause that 
you believe can make a dierence 
even if you feel at times you arent 
doing anything extremely signi
cant it does matter sometimes 
manual labor and time is the best 
gi you can give an organization 
sometimes its a voice you dont 
have to singlehandedly clean 
up the garbage from all the 
rivers to make a dierence in the 
environment
i went abroad to volunteer 
through an organization 
called international student 
volunteers you can visit 
isvolunteersorg to learn more 
about them and what they do 
but you dont have to leave the 
country to help a good cause 
there are organizations such 
as the red cross habitat for 
humanity united way and so 
many more that are doing great 
things across the us  locally 
programs in bozeman like eagle 
mount the gallatin valley food 
bank the boys and girls club 
and service saturdays through 
msu are just a few great ways 
to get involved and make a 
difference to learn more about 
bozeman and msu volunteer 
opportunities visit

opinion 
 7ursday september 3 2015
chances are if youve ever been on 
campus from 2 to 4 pm on monday 
wednesday or friday youve heard the spirit 
of the west marching band practicing 
behind the outdoor rec center e band 
is certainly present at football 
games standing in the student 
section surviving freezing tem
peratures and frozen mouthpieces 
just to add to the amazing game 
day atmosphere another notable 
fact if youve been around for 
awhile is that the band has been 
using the same exact uniforms 
for 17 years so this year amongst 
other changes director of bands 
nathan stark has announced that the band 
will nally purchase new uniforms with 
monetary support from president cruzado
first a quick history a few years ago 
the university decided to update the logos 
complete with a new cat head and m 
with that logo change came a new rule for 
the stadium no old logos are to be allowed 
in the stadium e logos and signage all 
throughout had to be changed e current 
band uniforms are in violation of this 
rule as they clearly display the old logo 
prominently on the le breast in an ugly 
monotonous blue not to mention they just 
look plain outdated and boring e new 
designs are far more uptodate including 
an option for a replaceable logo should the 
university ocially change it again is has 
the potential to save the band signicant 
money in the future and is an important 
step in keeping the band current with the 
university master plan  
despite needing new uniforms for 
many years the band has had a major 
problem raising the capital to fund new 
uniforms on their own is year the band 
cannot even promise a full cash equivalent 
of the scholarship to those who cannot 
accept a tuition waiver e price of a march
ing band uniform costs around the price of 
a nice tuxedo stark remarks at equates 
to around 500 a piece and when you are 
planning to purchase 200 new uniforms 
thats a lot of cash  totalling around 
100000 for reference thats enough to 
give three and a half instate students a 
tuition waver through four years of college 
how can the band aord this huge but 
extremely necessary purchase well with 
the help of president waded cruzado and 
dean nancy cornwell who according to 
an email sent out to band members by dr 
stark have committed 70 percent of the 
funding for this project specically 50 
percent from president cruzado and 20 
percent from dean cornwell
so why the band why spend all this 
money on them well a marching band 
is more than just a collection of people 
blowing into contraptions 
banging on things and running 
around on a football eld a 
marching band is a group of 
people with the goal to perform 
something amazing a marching 
band is the essence of synergy 
between music marching 
football people camaraderie and 
a well run university e spirit 
of the west has to be this essence at every 
occasion as a member of the band every 
time i put on my uniform i am reminded 
of what it truly means to be in a marching 
band it means hours and hours of work 
just for a mere 10 minutes of fame it means 
that even though you get to watch the 
vast majority of fans in the stands leave to 
do some halime tailgating you get the 
unique satisfaction of seeing those true fans 
who are just overjoyed to see us or when 
a little kid comes up asking for me to sign 
his helmet right next to all of the football 
players signatures it is a sense of belonging 
and accomplishment that most people dont 
get to experience at all in their life to be 
adored by thousands of people you dont 
know truly remarkable 
e fact that this university and its 
members and fans supports us the way they 
do it only makes me want to bring the 
vim more vigorously to be put bluntly our 
job at football games is to be the sideshow 
were there so the fans have something 
to look at when the football team is o 
doing something else were there to show 
the fans what it means to have vim and i 
could not be more proud to do so e band 
puts countless hours of strenuous work 
into producing a show that msu can be 
proud of and the nancial support of the 
university validates the importance of the 
bands work 
i am already looking forward to the 
new uniforms where the phrase whenever 
you wear these uniforms you personify 
the spirit of the west and the others who 
wore the uniform before you empowers 
you instead of making you go eww but 
until we will survive even if the tubas are 
in temporary uniforms that look like chef 
outts we already look and sound good all 
we need are uniforms to match
e new uniforms will make their 
debut in fall 2016

marching band deserving 
of new uniforms
with guidance provided by the 
blackstone launchpad and its director les 
craig msu students sam kern and aidan 

weltner are nearly nished developing 

their app sharelift that eases the process 

of carpooling for skiers and snowboarders
working as a team of eight led by 
craig the launchpad reviews numerous 

ideas each day including sharelift
craig always has a new strategy 
a new idea or a new perspective kern 

stated for anyone who is interested at 

all in entrepreneurship starting your own 

company or product you should check 

them out because its such an amazing free 

resource kern continued
its uber meets couch surfing for 
skiers said kern as he briefly described 

the app sharelift connects users who 

are looking for transportation to go 

skiing or snowboarding to persons 

who are driving up to the mountain 

already the drivers are skiers theyre 

going skiing anyways continued kern 

our goal is to make it cheaper to use 

sharelift than to drive alone
upon opening the app users will 
immediately be shown a list of people who 

are driving to a given ski area and the time 

that driver is leaving once a user looking 

for a ride nds the option that works best 

for them they can then request a pickup 

although there is a cost for passengers 

seeking a lift kern revealed the rider will 

pay about the cost of gas kern further 

predicted that a oneway ride to bridger 

bowl would cost about four dollars 
as the head of development kern and 
his colleagues have been building the app 

within meteor a java framework to create 

both an ios and android version of the 

app e android version is expected rst 

but both versions will be designed native to 

their respective operating system 
weltner who focuses on the business 
side of sharelift explained how skiers 

and snowboarders are unique  they have 

a single destination where 8590 percent of 
them are going to the same place  weltner 

indicated that it was this common destina
tion that gives sharelift its true potential 

as he continued to state that for skiers 

carpooling just makes sense 
majoring in marketing and photog
raphy weltners excitement came from 

his entrepreneurial spirit and passion 

for skiing itself he credits his confi
dence however to business professor 

dr terry profata 
after performing startup exercises in 
her class weltner stated she gave me the 

condence to handle the business side of 

things and even start sharelift in the 

rst place
using his business knowledge weltner 
initially sent out market research surveys 

to gauge whether or not sharelift was 

something worthwhile and to determine if 

a possible customer base exists based on 

the research people want to see something 

like this weltner said
besides weltners msu resources he 
also used stanfords online business lecture 

library along with forbes articles and per
sonal conversations with various venture 

capitalists after looking into paid services 
polo e social calendar is the rst 
of the two apps to be released launching 
late this september ceo wayland roberts 

and four other msu students anticipate 

their app will be a success among busy 

college students across the nation 
polo is about actual social interac
tion said elias horat msu architecture 

major and marketing director for polo 

instead of creating a new way to interact 

digitally polo aims to create software to 

enable interaction in the real world 
e idea for the app came to horat 
and his colleagues when they were discuss
ing how dicult it was to meet up in the 

short timeslots students nd throughout 

their days from there the group of friends 

consisting mostly of computer science stu
dents began casual brainstorming sessions 

to grow their rough idea into the app that 

polo is today
with intentions of solving the schedul
ing crisis horat and his associates face polo 
shows individuals which of their friends 
are available at a given time e app does 
this by having users input the times they 
are unavailable in a given week and then 
shares that availability with selected con
tacts if a user opens up the app and has an 

overlapping availability with a friend they 
can send out a marco which is essentially a 
rendezvous request when a user receives a 
marco they can either respond with a polo 
which acts as a conrmation or choose not 

to respond at all
while polo shares vacancies with 
friends it does not require users to submit 

additional information about where they 
will be during that time polo shares 
when you are busy with your friends 
without letting them know exactly what 
you are doing 
on most days i only have 20 minutes 
or so to grab lunch explained horat and 
trying to nd out which of my friends are 

free then actually meet up with them is 
nearly impossible with polo instead of 
texting a bunch of friends and asking them 
if they want to eat lunch i just look at my 
polo calendar immediately see who is 
free and send them a marco
looking to the future the team plans 
to expand their app beyond individual 
use upon launch the app allows users to

texas the bobcats competed in the 
27th annual bearkat invitational at 
sam houston state 
e bobcats opened tourna
ment play with a 31 win over the 
tulane green waves it felt great 
to get our rst win together as a 
team stand program msu 
head coach jj riley said to have 
that rst feeling winning together 
with a new team is always neat and 
a special time and it is something 
that we enjoyed e bobcats came 
out strong and built a 20 lead right 
ohe bat outscoring tulane 2518 
and 2523 tulane battled back in 
the third match before the bobcats 
put away the green waves in the 
fourth match 2624 e players 
have been working really hard and 
it is important for them to have 
experiences that make them happy 
and feel good about themselves so 
getting a win right out of the gates 
denitely helps
e bobcats had a couple hours 
to rest before playing university 
of texassan antonio e 
roadrunners defeated the bobcats in 
three with scores of 2517 2516 and 
2523 something we stress everyday 
is that we need to keep improving in 
everything we do and its important 
to have that mindset daily coach 
riley said we want our athletes 
to understand that we should never 
stop improving or learning as there is 
always more we can do or give
e bobcats showed improve
ment the next day with a command
ing win over prairie view am in 
the morning e bobcats defeated 
the panthers in three matches 2514 
2522 and 2518 e bobcats held 
advantages over the panthers in hits 
kills assists digs aces and blocks 
e great thing about this past 
weekend is that everyone contrib
uted from the freshmen all the way 
up to the seniors riley said
e bobcats fell to hosting team 
sam houston state in their nal 
game 31 e bobcats split matches 
with the bearkats before dropping 
the nal two matches we have 
some areas for sure to improve on 
when it comes to playing this game 
but a big area of focus right now is 
on our mentality toughness and 
learning what it takes to truly give it 
our best riley said e players are 
embracing it and doing a fabulous 
job
e bobcats will travel to the 
nevada tournament on sept 11 and 
12 to face the university of miami 
ohio and university of nevada 
e biggest goals for the nevada 
tournament are to keep improving 
on playing with great passion grit 
and investing in the idea of when 
the match is over we can walk o 
that court knowing that we gave 
everything we had riley said
as you take in the game this 
weekend at bobcat stadium 
take notice of that voice inside 
your head no not that voice  stop 
writing redrum that carpet is not 
scotch guarded im talking about 
the voice that rings in your ears until 
the day you die the stadium public 
address announcer
most football stadiums in america 
utilize the stadium public address an
nouncer pa for a number of tasks pas 
are responsible for recapping every play 
addressing the fans when needed and 
reading various advertisements among 
other things e bobcats have had pas for 
as long as i can remember and theyve all 
been very good but i have a few thoughts 
id like to share and if youre reading this 
lets face it you literally have nothing bet
ter to do
first does anyone else nd it odd 
that the powers that be decided we needed 
an immediate recap of the play that just 
happened in front of us you just saw it 
sure you might be interested in getting the 
name of the ball carrier andor tackler but 
unless youre sitting in row 999 with a pair 
of binoculars crampons three tanks of 
oxygen an existential sense of dread and a 
sherpa you can probably get some idea as 
to who made the play another thing oen 
times youll hear the pas announce a posi
tive play for the home team with a little 
more excitement but not much
twelve yard pass from prukop to 
griebel good for a bobcat rst down
boring personally id like to hear 
some diehard fans make these calls over 
the loudspeakers
holy  prukop with an amaz
ing twelve thousand million yard pass 
to griebel take that you incompetent 
defensive back your mother never loved 
you  super bowl
another issue of mine is announce
ments the pas make to the fansed 
here is a typical announcement we 
request your cooperation by supporting the 
participantls in a positive man
ner profanity racial or sexist comments 
or other intimidating actions  will not be 
tolerated and are grounds for removal from 
the game
well what good is that going to do is 
the average avid sports fan going to change 
their ways from such a statement i think 
pas would be a lot morctive if they 
said something like this  profanity racial 
or sexist comments will result in the fol
lowing first you will be removed from the 
game but not by traditional means instead 
you will be removed by catapult should you 
survive you will be dressed in a chicken suit 
and forced to pick up trash during the butte 
st patricks day parade where drunken 
patrons will be encouraged to hurl glass 
bottles in your direction you will then be 
shipped overseas where you will serve 35 
years of hard labor in a moroccan prison 
something like that might give belligerent 
fans second thoughts
one more thing pas these days 
have a ridiculous amount of sponsorships 
to read case ih red zone blue cross 
blue shield starting lineups and bobcat 
prowl presented by polaris is is not their 
doing of course and i suppose the bobcats 
are paid a pretty penny to say these sponsor
ships but does anyone else think this could 
eventually get out of hand
13 yard run by brekke puts the cats 
on the susans organic scotch tape 41 
and a half yard line
taylor sheridan with the 5 yard sack  
sponsored by bozeman piano repair and 
blimp dealership
injury timeout on the eld  
brought to you by obamacare
you typically wont hear pas say any
thing controversial i suppose this makes 
sense as no school would wish to alienate 
certain fans but imagine what a little vari
ety in announcers might sound like
for example a conservative announc
er carter intercepts the pass  similar 
to how patriotic american voters will 
hopefully intercept obamacare and every 
other socialist policy put forth by this 
administration that will surely bankrupt 
this country and its morals this election 
season
a liberal announcer e grizzlies 
fumble the football  similar to how re
publicans continue to fumble theirts 
to aid the average american but instead 
only serve the rich who are solely respon
sible for this nations vast wealth inequal
ity and declining middle class
e conservative announcer again 
what gives you stole my bit and why do 
we both have microphones
a bummer announcer ladies and 
gentlemen be sure to check out the conces
sion stands for some delicious food keeping 
in mind of course that some people in this 
town have no food at all
a drunk announcer er  eh  um  
pickles  no i love you no i love you
a millennial announcer   sorry i 
missed that last play i was too busy pho
tographing my food and casually calling 
people racist andor sexist on twitter 
hashtag activism
an announcer who needs a friend 
folks im sure you feel the same guilt as i do 
for burdening the earth with our presence 
slowly poisoning the land and its waters 
depleting the planet of its resources ensuring 
a worse tomorrow for our future generations 
not to mention the dysfunctional govern
ment they will inherit that is systemically 
incapable of handling these problems can i 
get a hug ere are 23345 of you a bobcat 
stadium attendance record surely one of you 
can spare this poor soul a hug
perhaps its for the best that everything 
remains the same wouldnt you agree 
great johnny here brought an ax
i have an announcement a dissertation on stadium public addresses

dealing with the fear 
of rejection
by adam waldorf
furious seven
e fast and furious movies have never 
appealed to me im not the type of person 
who watches a movie to look at cool cars and 
to see big explosions at said i have seen 
the majority of them excluding ve and six 
and to be honest this was one of the better 
ones
e plot didnt stray too far from the 
other ones deckard shaws jason statham 
brother is  in a coma and he blames dominic 
vin diesel he exacts his revenge leading 
to a series of exciting car chases and action 
sequences 
e car chases have steadily progressed 
into absurdity which makes it oddly more 
entertaining than previous installations if 
you follow the media at all and keep up with 
current celebrity deaths the cast changes 
wont surprise you but if youre going to see 
this to look at neat cars and explosions i 
dont think theres a better movie franchise 
to t your needs it is successful in entertain
ing the audience however i still think the 
series lacks quality given that every movie 
seems to have the same plot structure if you 
like the rest of the series then youll love this 
installment otherwise i wouldnt get too 
excited to see it  
cinderella
when i rst heard about the new 
cinderella movie and saw the trailer i 
was less than thrilled it didnt seem like 
anything new to me as i just saw it as 
another rehash of a story that everyone 
knows already i was right in assuming it 
wasnt going to be anything new but it was 
better than i was initially expecting  
for those of you who dont know the 
plot of cinderella get out of the house 
more its about a girl named ella lily 
james whose father dies and she is forced 
to live with her evil stepmother and 
stepsisters which isnt particularly ideal 
for her in this version she sees prince 
charming richard madden  in the woods 
and instantly falls in love and then goes 
to the palace ball to meet him again even 
though her stepmother is against it you 
probably know the rest it is a good retelling 
of the story but is very driven towards 
younger audiences who dont already know 
how cinderella goes it was well done but 
most people have already seen it before 
avengers age of ultron
superhero movies tend to follow 
a certain formula everything is 
happygolucky for the hero until some
thing doesnt quite go right which leads 
to chaos the heroes have some sort of 
inner conflict that tears them apart but 
they eventually work it out and fight the 
enemy theres a big battle which starts 
off well takes a turn for the worst which 
leads to something tragic then the odds 
are beaten and the hero wins in the end 
bringing peace to the world
age of ultron follows that same 
pattern when tony stark robert 
downey jr and bruce banner mark 
ruffalo create an artificial intelligence 
to keep the earth safe and make their 
lives a whole lot easier it doesnt go quite 
as they initially intended the ai decides 
that the avengers are a threat to the 
planet and decides to kill them which 
isnt really supposed to happen just like 
every marvel movie that has come out in 
the last decade its pretty easy to guess 
whats going to happen even though 
joss whedon does put his own touch of 
surprise in there and its entertaining to 
watch i would recommend it but dont 
expect to be surprised by anything you 
see
procrastinatorpreviewasking someone out is 
not easy nerves can 
overwhelm you and 
ll your head with ideas of 
what will happen if you are 
turned down 
 you like this person and dont want 
to be embarrassed by nding out 
they dont feel the same way it will 
probably hurt to hear a refusal and 
your nerves may have you focusing 
on the possibility of pain 
many will say to ask them 
just do it get it over with 
what if they say yes what have 
you got to lose e worst that 
can happen is that they say no 
but this is an oversimplied idea it 
isnt as easy as all that 
we tend to live in the 
moment what is physically 
happening right now what is 
my emotional state right at this 
moment how can certain actions 
aect these states if they say no 
we may think about what will 
happen next what if we end up 
alone for the rest of our lives 
we have all been single if you 
are reading this you are here you 
have made it to this moment and 
you are okay but that doesnt mean 
that we want to be alone forever 
or particularly like the idea we 
all like to know that someone is 
waiting for us at home someone 
who loves us wants us needs us 
whether it is a pet a child or a 
lover we nd comfort in others 
fear of rejection cannot be solved 
by saying the worst that can 
happen is that they say no our 
thoughts and fears will carry us far 
beyond that deceptively simple no
people say that we have to be 
open to possibilities we have to be 
realistic nothing lasts forever ese 
are not comforting thoughts we 
want the good things to last the bad 
things to go away we have every 
right to be terried to ask you want 
to grab a bite to eat but then if we 
dont ask well denitely be on our 
own we wont have someone at the 
end of the day avoiding rejection is 
less painful in the moment but is it 
less painful in the long run or will it 
just make things harder
by focusing on rejection and 
the accompanying pain we are 
focusing on feelings that we dont 
want so instead of focusing on 
what you dont want to feel try to 
think about what you do want to 
feel take a moment to ask yourself 
how you want to feel about this 
in the future do you want to feel 
anxious because you didnt ask do 
you want to constantly question 
yourself and ask what if or do 
you want to tell yourself that you at 
least gave it a shot that you had the 
bravery to do something about that 
question burning a hole in your 
mind bravery is not only found in 
actions of grandeur but also in the 
little things we do every day 
ask yourself what rejection 
really means getting rejected 
is not just about you it tells you 
something about someone else 
you are not unlovable or destined 
to be alone you are just not meant 
to be with that particular person 
at that particular point in time 
we make decisions every day 
decisions to cross the street to 
pass the class to try for that job 
perhaps we are just selsh enough 
to believe that rejection is a direct 
insult to ourselves
showing in september
avoiding rejection is less painful in the moment but is it less painful 
in the long run or will it just make things harder

for many sleeping inside of 
a snow cave in the middle of 
winter while enduring subzero 

temperatures sounds like a 

survival situation but for some 

msu students they just call that 

their weekend with upwards of 

500 members on their facebook 

group the msu backcountry ski 

and snowboard club embraces 

skiing and snowboarding by 

avoiding the lift lines and 

earning their turns
the clubs president 
ian 
nagelbrice is a lifetime skier 

and colorado native but 

didnt have much experience in 

backcountry skiing until he came 

to msu in 2012 
i hadnt skied 
backcountry more than one time 

and it was something that always 

interested me nagelbrice 

stated but 
i didnt know how to 

get into it although nagelbrice 

had limited experience in the 

backcountry he was a competi
tive freestyle skier throughout his 

life and expressed true passion 

for the sport the backcountry 

club seemed like a good place to 

meet people who wanted to go 

skiing and thats exactly what it 

provided he continued
last year the club hosted 
a ski movie premiere at the 

procrastinator theater on 

campus where they raised more 

than 400 to support the student 

run organization the club 

invited the 
inspired media ski 
crew to show off their latest ski 

films and several professional 

skiers and xgames medalists 

appeared at the showing 
nagelbrice has been working 
with 
inspired media for a 
showing of their newest film 

this year but stated he was 

having trouble finding a venue 

last year we sold out the 

procrastinator in less than two 

hours he said we want to step 

up in venue size for this years 

premiere nagelbrice expressed 

a desire to keep the showing on 

campus but due to scheduling 

interferences was unable to 

book any campus location that 

has seating capacity he desired 
the backcountry club is now 

looking to host the showing at an 

offcampus location like many 

ski films in bozeman  
aside from hosting 
their annual ski movie the 

backcountry club is active in 

campus activities members 

strive to volunteer at university 

events such as the legend of 

the bobcat and are planning to 

volunteer at the gallatin valley 

food bank this winter
overnight ski trips are also 
on the clubs agenda especially 

to their favorite spot at the bell 

lake 
yurts the club frequently 
takes trips around montana 

and nagelbrice explained how 

the club keeps those travel costs 

free for members we take the 
fundraising money from events 

like our ski movie and use that 

to pay for food gas and other 

travel costs nagelbrice then 

continued once you own the 

backcountry setup its a free way 

to ski and we want to keep it that 

way 
although nagelbrice said the 
organization is in a great place 

he also expressed interest in 

expansion alongside the clubs 

existing adventure 
report a 
detailed log that members fill 
out after a backcountry expedi
tion members are interested 

in creating short films of these 

experiences to further document 

their best runs and worst bails 

nagelbrice would also like to 

see the adventure log turn into 

an extensive resource that can be 

used to study snowpack trends in 

the area which would allow for 

safer navigation of backcountry 

regions for newcomers
primarily  nagelbrice is 
working to have avalanche level 
1 classes at msu  subsidized 

by the university safety is the 

primary point said nagelbrice 

as he went on to explain how 

we was looking into developing 

a scholarship to help fund the 

aforementioned avalanche safety 

classes
nagelbrice is incredibly keen 
on backcountry safety but stated 

that above all we just want to 

enrich the skiing community 

through celebration for the sport 

we all love
the backcountry club will 
be holding their first meeting 

sept 10 from 530 pm  730 

pm in sub ballroom d 

they can be contacted at

rbinwhen he moved to bozeman 
aaron grusonik planned to take a 
oneyear internship as he nished 

his degree before moving back to 

california at plan however 

quickly fell apart
is semester marks the beginning 
of grusoniks sixth year with msu 

and all signs point to him remaining 

rmly entrenched in his current 

position as associate dean of students 

and director of student welfare 

books line the walls of his small 
basement oce in the sub  platos 
last days of socrates and malala 
yousafzais 
i am malala have a shelf 
to themselves  and blackandwhite 
ansel adams prints sit beside a bright 

portrait of a colorful sunset a surfer 

silhouetted against the waves
e whole goal is to be a resource 
of the students he said describing 

his job 
if people ever need anything 
come see us and well point them in 
the right direction
while the dean of students oce 
has a team atmosphere and any of 
the sta can respond to a given crisis 

grusonik is the ocial in charge of 

matters relating to safety he has been 

the director of student welfare since 

president cruzado created the position 
for the 20132014 school year 
one of his rst acts aer moving 
from the counseling oce to his 
current position was pushing for 
greater awareness and training among 

both sta and students to help them 

recognize problems among students as 

they began developing
were focusing on getting to 
problems when theyre a struggle 

not a crisis grusonik said were 

nding out about situations as theyre 
happening rather than aer
grusonik also helped rebuild the 
dean of students website making it 
easier than ever for anyone to report a 

concern about a member of the msu 

community concerns can range 

from nancial or academic diculty 
to suicide threats or substance and 
alcohol abuse
so far grusonik believes his eorts 
have been successful e oce 
received 150 reports last year up 

from 100 the year before which he 

attributed to greater awareness and 

use of the reporting system not an 

upsurge in problems
weve received more reports in the 
rst week this year than all last year 
but thats because were more public 
he said
despite his eorts however 
grusonik said that not all students 

get the help they need between 

12 and 15 students made serious 

attempts at suicide last year he said 

and unfortunately three succeeded 
he also conrmed that several 
students had attempted suicide so far 

this school year leading to a number 
of hospitalizations he believes that 

none of those students however were 

in contact with campus resources
students that get plugged into 
resources very rarely harm them
selves he claimed adding that msu 

has similar rates of attempted suicide 

and other issues to similarlysized 

schools throughout the northwest
when not working grusonik 
enjoys spending time outside in his 

adopted state snowboarding skiing 

shing hunting  you cant beat it 

he smiled snow sports were a natural 

shi for grusonik an experienced 

surfer of the california coast 
ough he enjoys montana and 
doesnt give california much of a 
thought these days he admitted it still 
held some appeal saying 
i miss the 
beach  
i miss the ocean
grusonik and his wife laurie an 
education advisor with msu used 

to drive an hour to the coast to go 

surng on friday nights until the sun 

went down e two began dating 

soon aer meeting during their 
freshmen year of college and have 
been married for 13 years
aer receiving his undergraduate 
degree grusonik got a masters 

degree in marriage and family 

therapy anks to his time as an 

athlete through high school and 

college and working as a coach for 
several teams grusonik initially 
planned to get into sports psychol
ogy he moved into counseling 
aer realizing how hard it was to get 
started on a career in that eld
he returned to school aer practic
ing for several years when a mentor 
encouraged him to pursue clinical 
psychology he earned his doctorate 

in clinical psychology focusing more 

on applied practice than research so he 

could continue working with patients 
and forming relationships
i dont have as deep a connection 
with students and 
i miss that he 
said thinking back on his days as a 
counselor when he would oen see 
the same clients for extended periods 

of time he added that this was 
largely made up for by the pleasure 

of working with many dierent 

students
grusoniks position was created 
with temporary funding and on a trial 

basis but he has high hopes it will be 

made permanent when reviewed at 

the end of this year
e goal is to help students 
he said and if they decide that the 

money for my position can be used 

better 
i would encourage them to 

cancel my job 
he paused a moment thoughtful 
then added smiling but all signs are 

looking good

college comes with a lot of 
nancial burden when consider
ing the rising costs of tuition 
parking permits housing and 
books it is easy to see 

why one might not want 
to add add the costs 
associated with owning 
a vehicle to their budget 
moreover with a lack of 

parking resources and 
uctuating gas prices it 
is easy to see why those 

who own vehicles would 
nd driving around bozeman 
and daily commutes to campus 
unappealing whether we live on 
or o campus most of us have been 

or will be in positions demanding 
transportation
msu students currently have 
access to free transportation 

through the streamline which 
is great for students with exible 
schedules or residences near bus 
stops ere is also carpooling for 
those who like to turn their friends 
into taxi services finally there are 

those rolling their lamborfeeties 
and chevrolegs what if 
i told you 
there is a cheap viable alternative 

that other cities have already 
implemented
transportation could be made 
readily accessible to msu students 

and bozeman residents through a 

city or university operated bicycle 
rental system bike share programs 

are growing in popularity all over 
the world our neighbors to the 
north have a public bicycle system 

established in montreal with 
more than 450 stations and over 
5000 bicycles denvers program 

is known as bcycle and oers 
annual passes to local students 
for 49 at is less than a third 
the cost of an msu sb parking 
permit daily and monthly rates 

are also available making access 
to the program as convenient as 
possible
for those of you unfamiliar with 
how a bike share system typically 

functions they are cityfunded 
and operated modied bike racks 
are erected throughout the city 

as selfserve bike rental stations 
where bikes can be withdrawn and 

deposited 
renters acquire bike 
rental passes ranging from 24 hours 
to a year in length 
in some areas 
public bicycle programs are free for 
the rst 30 to 45 minutes of use
why should a similar 
system be put into eect 
here in bozeman ere 
are countless scenarios 
where this system would 
prove advantageous 
perhaps a student 
wants to meet friends 
downtown without 

the risk of driving 
back inebriated or leaving their 
vehicle to be towed 
renting a bike 
would be very favorable for many 

outofstate students and those 
studying abroad both situations in 
which buying a bicycle for a term 

is not cost eective ose owning 

vehicles and parking permits may 
still nd a 20 to 30 minute bike 
ride is quicker than searching for 

that one parking spot that may or 

may not become available in time 
for your aernoon class
a public bike system member
ship is more comparable to an 
investment than a fee consider 
the hundreds of dollars spent on 
parking permits throughout the 

duration of your msu attendance 

add to that the cost of fueling 
your vehicle from daily commutes 
to and from campus 
even with 
parking permits 
i have fallen 

victim to situations demanding the 
use of paid parking and 
i am sure 
i 
am not alone compare these costs 

to a 49 annual membership
in addition to the nancial 
benets bike sharing guarantees 

available parking ough students 

are oered parking permits that 
guarantee access to specic lots on 
campus they are not guaranteed 
available parking spaces e 
lack of availability will be greatly 
worsened during the construction 
of the parking garage ose 

with flot parking access will 

nd the lincoln street site closes 
quite frequently for msu events 
nevertheless the bicyclists are 
seemingly the only ones safe from 
parking inconveniences
ere are few reasons not to 
be on board with a bike share 

program the system would help 
combat air pollution ease trac 
problems promote exercise 

reduce du
is limit mooching 
and lessen feet blisters 
you do 
not have to worry about the or 

storage of a bicycle e bikes are 
there when you want them and 
gone when you do not better 
yet consider the convenience of 
a new bike without maintenance 

responsibilities 
even if you 
are not interested in utilizing 
the system there is reason for 
excitement think of all the 
students riding bikes and freeing 
up parking spaces

fouryear universities are notoriously 
expensive even aer taking scholar
ships and nancial aid 
into account is is a problem 
because people understand that in 

modern america social mobility 
is incredibly dicult without 
some form of higher education 

what potential students might not 

realize is how a useful degree other 

than a traditional bachelors can be 

since college is typically advertised 

as a fouryear program students will end up 
working towards a degree that might not be 
wanted or needed
e reality for some people is 
that going to a fouryear institu
tion may not be the right option 
many of people might be more 
successful at a community college 

nd a job closer to their skills at 

a trade school or even want just 

an associate degree 
if all of these 
other forms of higher education 

are also available to students then 
a fouryear degree as a necessity is clearly a 

myth
many people go into college right out of 
high school with no idea what they want to 

study which is not a bad thing college is aer 

all the perfect place to gure out what to do 

with ones future by the time most individuals 
gure out what they want out of a degree they 
could be looking at a fouryear program aer 

already investing one or more years of school to 

gure out their professional goals for people 
who can aord it the expense is ne but if 

were talking about loans the total will add up 
incredibly fast on average msu students who 
nd jobs in their elds only paying around 64 
percent of their income on 
loans is percentage is not 
bad but the reality is that a 

lot of students arent going 

to be hired right out of 

college and many of those 
who do are going to end up 
in lowpaying internships
a signicant number of 
people dont even graduate 

and as of last year only 
496 percent of students 
who studied at msu 

even graduated less than half of those with a 

fouryear degree and the rest with either taking 
six years or earning an associate degree is 
percentage is not great evidence to support a 

fouryear degree as best option for some people 

however something can be said for msus 
acceptance rate in regards to this issue 
e high acceptance rate and relatively low 
cost of admission leads to certain individuals 
attending msu who might not be able to 
aord college or could 
have been more successful 
elsewhere when new 

students end up spending 

a year or two at msu 

they discover that a 

fouryear institution isnt 

right for them and are 

now stuck having paid 

for some education that 

theyre not going to use 

and not enough educa
tion to benet from the perks of having a 

degree student loans add up fast and if 

you dont nish college its a pretty expensive 

mistake 
students from low income backgrounds 
are impacted more by these loan debts than 

those who come from auent backgrounds 

by making college a nancial institution it 

has to be sold 
in selling college to as many 
students as possible msu opens the door 

for students to be negatively nancially 

impacted considering higher education has 

become such a necessity in pushing forward 

in the modern job market it shouldnt be a 

marketed like a product when somebody 

looks at higher education they should 

consider that there are more options than 

just a fouryear degree
higher 
education e myth of the fouryear university

during the 
summer msu 

parking services 
installed a brand new 
pay lot parking system 
when this system came 
online on aug 31 the 
parking lot switched 
from a gatecontrolled 
payonexit system to a 
payanddisplay system 

where you prepurchase 

the hours you need in 

advance then display 

a printed ticket in the 

window of your car the 

parking lot in downtown 

bozeman uses a payon

exit system very similar to 

the old pay lot way albeit 
automated so no human 
attendant is needed the 

payanddisplay system 

is similar to streetside 

metered parking except 

that a ticket is needed on 

the car preventing the use 

of leftover time
in an email sent out 
twice to msu students 

and faculty 
kurt blunck 
manager of parking 

services up the new 

system by claiming no 

more lines either getting 

in or getting out this 

has not always been the 

case especially consider
ing when one of the two 

centrally located pay 
kiosks stopped working on 

sept 4 which resulted in 

a line of 20 people waiting 

to use the one 

working kiosk 

it also means 
that users have 

to keep track 

of exactly when 

their ticket 

expires and to 

know exactly 

how much time 

they will need for their 

visit also while it takes 

considerably shorter to 

leave the lot it takes 

exceptionally longer to 

get into the lot because 

one must park walk to 
the kiosk purchase a 

ticket then return to their 

car to display the ticket 
this can mean 

considerable 

backtracking if 

someone parks 

near the back or 

if they are late 

another type of 

parking payby

stall is different 

in that one 
inputs the stall number at 

the kiosk and there is no 

need to return to the car 

as the timestamp and stall 

number can be accessed 

electronically via parking 

enforcement
that being said the 
new system includes great 

features and advantages 

such as credit card 

acceptance cat card usage 

to come 
improvements 
also include no longer 

having to maintain and 

use the old parking 

gates which are almost 

10 years old the new 

system also allows use of 

coupons so event hosts 

can pay for guest parking 

they are also much less 

expensive to maintain and 

they require no human 

attendant however it will 

require policing of the lot 

to make sure users are not 
going over their allotted 

time
while the lot itself is 
on the fast track to be 

demolished to make way 

for a new building and 

parking garage the use 

of the new pay system is 

transitional and a test 

to ensure pay system 

usability the road to the 

new parking garage and 

to a new system for paid 

parking is a rough one 

full of many challenges 

and trials fortunately 

parking services is being 

proactive in ensuring 

the success of parking on 

campus
potential problems spotted in new paid parking lot

asmsu president disappoints 
should 
step down
edit
ori
alin last weeks edition the 
exponent published a story 
detailing asmsu president 
gwynn simeniuks august du
i charge simeniuk has made it clear 

that despite the incident she has 

no plans to step down from her 

position 
in a statement she wrote 
i want to follow through on the 
commitment 
i made this past spring 

to serve the student body as your 

asmsu president 
i believe that 
i can still be a voice for our students
when students enroll in seven 
or more credits at msu they pay 

an asmsu fee totaling 8595 

once delegated the student fees 

fund a variety of programs some 

of the programs that receive partial 
funding include the streamline bus 

system the oce of sustainability 

and e msu 
exponent
what some students arent aware 
of is that simeniuk is in charge 

of delegating over 2 million in 

student fees and she has the author
ity to allocate the money as she sees 

t msu students are also funding 

simeniuks salary through a portion 

of the asmsu fee as president 

simeniuk recieves roughly 1000 

per month with an overall salary 

of 10000 she also receives an 

instate tuition waiver of 2500 per 

semester as part of her presidency 
simeniuk is the ocial msu 
student representative and as such 

we should hold her to the highest of 
standards  she is representing the 

entire student population of msu
when simeniuk was charged 
with a du
i she failed to 
adequately represent the students 

of msu which is one of her main 

duties as asmsu president 

as outlined in the asmsu 

constitution simeniuk has three 

specic duties including 

uphold the asmsu 

constitution and bylaws 
be the ocial representative of 

asmsu and msu students 
budget for the asmsu 

administration  
 at the time of publication simeniuk 
was unable to further comment on the 

status of her legal process 
regardless of the legal outcome 
simeniuks actions have brought 

enough negative attention to our 

student government and univer
sity while we do not necessarily 

doubt simeniuks ability to lead 

the students of msu we think 

that her past actions should she 

remain in oce would continue 

to tarnish the reputation of 

asmsu msu and the bozeman 

community mistakes are inevi
table but the decisions that led 

to her arrest endangered the lives 

of our peers teachers friends 

family and members of the 

bozeman community simeniuks 

continued presence as asmsu 

president does not accurately 
reect the values of montana state 

university students  
simeniuk concluded her written 
apology by inviting a dialogue 

regarding her incident 
i would 
like to hear your questions 

thoughts and concerns regarding 

this issue

on thursday sept 10 
which begins at 600 
pm in sub 235 public 
comment is the first item 
on the agenda 
under the lights the 
montana state football 
team got off to a slow 
start despite the high 

energy in the stadium 
and the reloaded offense 
and defense facing off against the 

division ii fort lewis skyhawks the 
nationally ranked bobcats 

struggled out of 
the gate 
failing to 
score on their rst four possessions 

of the game only nally punching the 
ball in on a chad newell 1yard dive 
into the endzone with just under ve 

minutes remaining in the rst half 
newell a junior did not look espe
cially impressive in his rst game as 

the feature back in the msu offense 
despite his two short touchdown 
runs only managing 
a pedestrian 31 
yards per 
carry
things picked up though for the 
cats in the second half as they 

managed to piece together a few 
scoring drives and wore down fort 

lewis eventually emerging victorious 
by a score of 4514 quarterback 
dakota prukop engineered a couple 
deep downeld bombs to sophomore 
wideout justin paige and closed out 

two drives with short 
td passes to 
sophomore 

mitchell 
herbert prukop also ran in for one 

touchdown and had another called 
back due to a holding penalty the 
junior did look a bit rusty coming 

off last years breakout campaign 
he only completed 14 of his 24 pass 
attempts and at times looked antsy in 
the pocket 
prukop admitted as much during 
the postgame press confer
ence but added that he 
expects to be ring 
on all cylinders 
when the cats 
take off for 
eastern 
washington in two weeks game 
speed is way different than practice 
 im usually a pretty calm guy but 
inside tonight i felt pretty wound up 

 adrenaline pumping through my 
veins it felt good though to be back 
on the eld competing
the revamped defense on the other 
hand got off to a solid start under the 

tutelage of new defensive cocoordi
nator kane ioane head coach rob 

ash praised the unit after the game 

saying they were playing hard and 
playing aggressive and thats exactly 
what we want to see from them
the defensive pressure generated 
an interception as well as keeping fort 
lewis quarterback jordan doyle consis
tently on the move the squad  one 
of the divisions worst last season  
looked a bit suspect against the run 

especially considering the lower tier 
opponent they squared off against 
the cats gave up 174 yards on the 
ground but only 103 through the 
air the true test comes up on sept 

19 when they will face a retooled 
and aggressive eastern washington 
offense    
coach ash says the team is ready 
for the challenge despite the 

slow start ive said for 40 

years now the biggest 
improvement a 
team makes is between game one 
and game two you nally get to see 
yourself on lm and in a game and 
so thats what we need to do weve 

got to look at this game and learn all 
that we can  and weve got plenty of 
time to do that
watch for that when the cats take 
on the ewu eagles on the red turf in 

cheney washington the game kicks 
off at 205 pm and will be nationally 
televised on root

william and mary virginia tech university 

of virginia and most recently university of 
oklahoma boasting 23 years of coaching 
experience 
reeves also played collegiate 
tennis at the university of south carolina 
reeves was drawn to bozeman because 
of the community culture and support that 

bozeman oers 
it is a tremendous environ
ment for my family and 
i 
reeves said 
montana state was also key in bringing him 

to coach for the bobcats e camaraderie 

of the athletic department sta and admin
istration as well as their willingness and 

commitment to work together for the greater 

good helped bring 
reeves to msu 
e bobcat women nished last season 
1113 overall and 47 in conference play 
is will be a learning year for us all 
reeves said foundations are important 
to any lasting structure so we will devote 
an inordinate amount of energy towards 
building a base and getting it right 
reeves 
also has goals for the bobcats style of play 
our aim is to play the game of tennis with 
total class 
reeves explains
e bobcats are young this year with 
no seniors on the roster but 
reeves has 
condence in each and every player ey 
will each play very important roles and will 
be leaders in their own way 
reeves said e 
new man in charge has large yet practical 
plans for the bobcats in the upcoming 
seasons first we need to become relevant 
within the big sky conference 
reeves 
said e next step is to begin contesting 

for conference championships not until

bobcats but 
reeves believes it to be possible 
training improving each players game and 

working as a team will be the initial charge 

reeves said sure our drive will be towards

sport
s   11by will hamelive got a question 
for you who cares 
about postgame press 
conferences seriously who 
amongst you common fans 

truly cares about canned 

corny questions being 

answered with canned 

corny answers
except for the truly devout 
sports fan the only people who 
really care about the postgame 

press conference are the press 
mainly because it is part of the 

job but for me at least some
times they can get obtrusive
heres what 
i mean 
every 
once in awhile on 
espn youll 
watch an exciting football 

or basketball game full of 

astounding feats of athleticism 
and teamwork after the game 
youll be treated to indepth 
analysis with knowledgeable 
experienced analysts explaining 
the intricacies of the important 
plays that won the game 
youre 
about to find out how the 
quarterback knew to throw 
the gamewinning touchdown 
behind his back while doing 
a frontflip when the anchor 
interrupts saying were going 
to live to the postgame press 
conference as coach hayden 
fox takes the podium
coach what are your thoughts 
on the game
the game was good

sometimes you will see an 
interesting press conference but 
this usually only occurs when 

the interviewee melts down and 
shouts at the press jim moras 

playoffs rant dennis greens 
they are who we thought they 
were rant and herm 
edwards 
you play to win the game rant 
come to mind however by 

and large you will rarely hear a 
reporter ask a provocative ques
tion lest they lose their right to 

ask questions and you will rarely 
hear a coach or player provide 

a provocative answer lest they 
create a distraction for which 

the entire team must answer
in fact the most popular press 
conference events that have 

occurred over the past year have 

been events that have subverted 
their genre the first is when 

seattle seahawks running back 
marshawn lynch who in a 
follow up to his previous years 
super bowl silence went to his 
press conference and answered 

every question with 
im just 
here so 
i dont get fined
the press was outraged as 
they were the year before that 

lynch refused to answer the 
tough questions such as whos 
the best player on your team 
or whats your prediction for 
the game 
you know the tough 
questions but the irony that the 
sports writers failed to under
stand was that lynchs refusal to 

talk and the way he went about 
not talking made for a far more 
compelling narrative than if he 
had simply answered the cookie 

cutter questions with cookie 
cutter answers his press confer
ence or lack thereof if you chose 

to think of it as such got more 
attention and generated more 
conversation than any of the 
others at the super bowl
the second event that 
subverted the genre and proved 

how little people care about the 
questions and answers occurred 
when nba mvp golden state 
warrior stephen curry brought 

his two year old daughter to 
the postgame conference as 

he gave the usual answers to 
the usual questions his infant 

daughter went about being 
adorable and instantly became 

a youtube phenomenon of 
course some members of the 
media notably on 
espn2s first 
take were displeased with the 

distraction but again similar 
to lynch this subversion of 
the format became far more 

compelling and interesting than 
anything a regular press confer
ence could produce
personally if 
i were an 
athlete 
i might think to use 

this to my advantage
a reporter will you had 
a rough day from the field 
going 2 for 56 and getting three 

technical fouls which is odd 
considering you can only get 
two how do you respond
will instantly holds up a 
puppy distracting everyone on 
the previous game the puppy 
becomes a twitter sensation
the next day the same 
reporter will you were even 

worse today going scoreless 
flipping off the fans and punch
ing a crippled widow hot dog 
vendor how do you respond
will instantly holds up a 
kitten distracting everyone 
from the game and lawless 
behavior the kitten eventually 
gets its own reality tv show 
purring in portland
the next day the same 
reporter will after fouling 

out in the first three seconds 

of the game you went to half 
court performed a pagan ritual 

and managed to summon satan 
and his army of demon angels 

who are currently destroy
ing the world how do you 
respond
will instantly holds up a cute 
baby who immediately becomes 
youtubes biggest celebrity and 
is elected to the state senate
other times reporters will try 
to ask a threesecond question 
with a 20second statement 
after game 4 of this years 
nba finals cleveland cavalier 
timothy mozgov was asked 
such a question the center 
responded by asking that is a 
long question can you repeat 

please
how long is it until we get 
something like this timothy 
obviously a tough loss given 
that  five minutes later you 
scored 30 points three months 
ago  seven minutes later 

 neon is a noble gas  10 
minutes later  
king john 
of 
england signed the magna 
carta in 1215 what were your 
thoughts about the game 
the only part of the press 
conference that can be interest
ing is when the press interviews 
the losing team especially if 
they lost a close game and even 
more so if they lost because 
they messed up 
imagine chris 
webber and his extra timeout 
during the 1992 ncaa mens 
basketball championship 

apparently theres nothing more 
interesting than asking a bunch 
of college kids or grown men 
and women who are on the verge 
of tears why they lost
typically youll see the 
reporters be as diplomatic as 

possible trying hard not to get 
the affected parties to curse 
them out personally 
i think 
they might get a more honest 
and interesting answer if they 

asked the following
coach obviously a tough 
loss my question is what the 
in  was that
of course youd never hear 
a good coach give an honest 
answer to such a question 

or an answer that in any way 
would be construed as contro
versial coach ash especially 

fits in this mold do you know 
why because hes smart thats 
why look at the new 
york 
giants and the new 
york jets 
same market but one team 

the giants eschews excessive 
press while the jets seem to 
create an offfield headline 
every week guess which team 

has one a few super bowls 
lately
so in conclusion 
i suppose 
the conferences have their place 
but lets temper the coverage 
otherwise keep keep everything 
under fifteen seconds no not 
the questions the entire thing
pressed for entertainment the art 
 of the postgame press conference
by and large you will rarely hear a reporter ask a 
provocative question lest they lose their right to ask 
questions

the game as settlers of catan meets

expanded their idea in the spring 

of 2014 aer receiving government

the company over 300000 and

stunning and one of the best parts

 there are over 100 all unique and

it was a nice 
touch to have artist and animator 

credits appear if the player mouses

may be animals the studio chose 
animals as characters to transcend 

cultural boundaries  as well as 

being cute according to producer 
trent 
kusters but armello 
avoided getting silly or cartoony 
e storyline is straightforward but 

edges towards the kind of gritty fairy 
tale thats been popular for the last 
couple of years 
its not necessarily 
bad that the plot is so spare but 

its not enough by itself to carry 
the game ankfully the art and 
individual character background 

stories stepped in to pick up the 

slack 
overall the player classes are 
fairly wellbalanced ere are eight 

dierent characters to choose from 

each one with a special power related 
to their clan so both of the wolf 
characters have melee bonuses the 

bear characters have spiritmagic 

bonuses etc e prologue of the 
game which doubles as a tutorial 
lays out the specic strengths of each 

clan though it only includes four of 

the playable characters
im not a fan of multiplayer 
games but armello has an online 

multiplayer option if youre into 

that local multiplayer isnt possible 
yet but its rumored to be coming 
soon as an expansion 
if like me you 
prefer singleplayer youre in luck 
because the articial intelligence 
a
i system in the game isnt nearly 
as stupid as a
is usually are ere 
are multiple ways to win and the 
ai players will choose the method 
that their clan favors e player is 

free to pursue any of the end options 
or spend their time messing up the 
computer players attempts to win
one of the only downsides of the 
game is that you cant skip the turns 

of the a
i players 
it makes sense 
considering that you can play eect 

cards at any point whether its your 
turn or not and you can be attacked 
by any of the other players or enemies 
in the game during their turns but 
it can get a little irritating watching 
the 
kings guards attack the same 
bane over and over without being 

able to click through it and while 
the plot of the game is simple its still 
interesting to watch as the characters 
make their motives known
i highly recommend armello 
games are a decent length about 20 
turns per player and its very easy to 

get sucked into the just one more 
game trap armello is available 
through steam and the playstation 
store for 1999

kombucha
by 
raymond
 po
rter
when you walk into the 
average establishment 
downtown and ask for 
a cold beverage on tap you should 
expect to receive beer 
if you walk 
into townshends tea and ask the 

same question do not expect beer
kombucha which originated in china 
many centuries ago hit health food fanatics 
and alternative medicine subcultures 

around the 1990s in america and cur
rently is a mainstream trend in stores and 
kitchens across the country from 2013 to 
2014 kombucha saw 29 percent growth 

representing nearly a 123 million industry
growth of the market has not stopped 
there 
kombucha brewers 
international a 
nonprot trade organization representing 
90 percent of commercial kombucha pro
ducers estimates that as of 2015 kombucha 
is currently a 600 million industry 
townshends teas which originated in 
portland and now has teahouses in bend 
or and bozeman also brews their own 

kombucha under the name brew dr e 

brand is available in bottles in stores across the 

continent from alaska to colorado to texas 
e bozeman shop was started by 
melissa and scott herron e husband 

and wife duo opened the teahouse in 

april 2014 and have been in business ever 

since e shop specializes in highquality 

looseleaf tea and also oers bubble tea and 
of course kombucha
e drink is made by rst brewing a batch of 
caeinated tea some people prefer to use green 
tea while others prefer to make their kombu
cha using black tea e key is the caeine so 
herbal teas will not work aer the tea has been 
brewed it needs to be fermented  
many people know kombucha as the 
mushroom tea is 

is because of the agent 

which brewers use to 
ferment the tea known 
as the symbiotic colony 

of bacteria and 
yeast or 
scob
y it resembles a 
fungus or mushroom 

hence the misnomer for its product
some of the yeasts produce alcohol while 
certain strains of bacteria consume it and 

emit acetic acid especially acetobacter 

nicknamed the acetic acid bacteria is 

gives the brew a slight vinegar avor 

e end result is a series of biochemical 
reactions that yield an eervescent beverage 
which resembles beer yet has similar health 

benets as yogurt generally speaking the 

yeasts are responsible for the carbonation 

and alcohol as they consume the sugar 

much like students at a university the 

bacteria consume alcohol and caeine 

is creates a live probiotic mix which is 
believed to aide in digestion and absorption 
of nutrients aer it is consumed 
brew drs kombucha is unpasteurized 
melissa herron coowner of townshends 

explained that means we keep all of the 
bacteria in the drink so all of the healthy 
goodness makes it into your gut
some other brands of kombucha are 
pasteurized for safety concerns but this 
process kills most of the benecial bacteria 

which is arguably the potions dening 
characteristic aer about ten days the 
initial fermentation is complete
what gives each 
kombucha its uniqueness 

is a second brew where 
extra avoring can be 
added 
everything from 
fruit to herbs and even 

hops can be added to 

enhance the avor and 
transform kombucha from an ancient 

remedy into a modern refreshment
herron recommends brew drs white 
rose avor for people who want to try 
kombucha for the rst time 
it is a light and 
owery avor which makes refreshing and 

gentle introduction to the strange brew
aer sampling all the avors on tap two 
favorites include the spiced apple and the 

newest avor citrus hops spiced apple 
resembles a cider due to its cinnamon spice 
and crisp sweetness 
it is the perfect drink 
for a snowy autumn day citrus hops on 
the other hand is a refreshing orangey drink 
that brings out an uncommon avor prole 

in hops usually when you think of hops 
you think of a deep bitter 
ipa but since 
the fermentation process is completely 
dierent the drink ends up being crisp 

which makes for a refreshing kombucha t 
for the last days of summer
much like students 
at a university the 
bacteria consume 
alcohol and 
caffeine
the new kombucha comes in a wide selction of avors ranging from spiced apple to citrus hops

asmsu ofce receives major renovation
by tyler 
stitt
every week while school is in 
session over 40 students and 
faculty operate in the asmsu 

oce e asmsu oce located 
in sub 221 recently underwent 
renovations this past summer to 

improve the visual appearance and 
functionality of the workspace 
originally suggested by former 
asmsu president destini 
french and vice president jordan 
garceau in jan 2015 the renova
tions took place through july and 
were nished in early august 
french and garceau proposed 
their plan with the intention of 

raising awareness of the oce 
and making it more accessible 
to students once their plan was 

backed with the support of their 

colleagues asmsu business 
manager john cowles took the 
lead on turning their idea into 

reality
we needed a better place 
to spend time and work said 

cowles an industrial engineer
ing major who enjoys nancial 

investment and entrepreneurship 

cowles was hired january 2015 
and rehired for this academic year 

in april 
according to cowles nal 
proposal asmsu has excess 

reserve monies to spend on oce 

upgrades has recently under
gone an organizational structure 

change and is actively seeking to 

rebrand itself on campus 
e main oce upgrades 
pertained to glass replacement 

signage furniture and av equip
ment most notably a new sliding 
glass entry way facing the hallway 
was installed moving the door to 

the main corridor was the single 
biggest change for accessibility 
cowles explained as the old door 

placement was too hidden and 
oen dissuaded individuals from 
coming into the oce
e end cost for the oce 
overhaul was  53500 including 
18250 for the oce storefront 
750 for the door windows 

4200 on exterior signage and 

vinyl graphics 4447 on av 
equipment 20848 for oce 
furniture and 3000 on minor 
oce furnishings e project 
nished 2000 under budget and 

now serves as a model for future 
renovations in the sub all reno
vations and changes are expected 
to last the asmsu oce upwards 
of 50 years
chelsey wilson the asmsu 
support team manager said that 
the renovations simplied the 
way of the oce and added a 

new perspective to our campus 
community on asmsu wilson 
also stated that she and her team 

have noticed an increase in ap
plications to the asmsu oce 
since the renovations as well as an 
increase in quality of atmosphere 

for asmsu employees we care 
about our students wilson said 
and we want to be accessible and 

available for them these renova
tions allow that wilson also ex
pressed that shes been impressed 

with the amount of individuals 

coming into the oce that are 
providing positive feedback and 
compliments on the changes
asmsu administrative 
associate cormac sullivan has 
worked his position for over a year 
and loves the new look and feel of 
the oce 
ive seen an increase 
in trac sullivan said e old 
oce door created a lot of confu
sion he continued sullivans 
favorite changes are the new 

windows and glass doors in the 

front of the oce ey allow us 
to see students and the students 
to see us

thy 
adams
msu and senator steve daines hosted the 
rst annual high 
tech jobs summit at jabs 
hall and the sub ballrooms on sunday and 
monday e summit provided a day and a 

half of panels and speakers addressing the 

importance of providing high tech jobs to 

the state and how government academia and 

private sector companies can work together 

to further the availability of higher paying 

ste
m jobs in the area and state 
speakers from around the state and 
country praised both the pristine land
scape of the state and the dedication of 

msu to the technology and engineering 

elds daines helped setup and moderate 

the summit which his sta said would be 

held every two years going forward  msu 

president waded cruzado opened the 

second day of the summit with a speech to 

employees and management of high tech 

companies in bozeman and montana 

msu students and faculty and communi
ty members came tosee individual speakers 

by their professors
e summit included many prominent 
speakers from industry including local 

rightnow

dr dava newman 
retired c
eo of 
intel 
corp craig barrett and two of the ve 

current us federal communications 

commission members michael o
reilly 
and ajit pai  
in the panel with the fcc commission
ers topics ranged from the changing role of 
government and regulation of the technol
ogy sector to ways to make broadband 
internet more available in rural areas of 
montana and the rest of the country as well 

as eorts by the current commissioners to 

enact net neutrality rules commissioner 
o
reilly spoke about some of the challenges 
of bringing internet access in rural areas 
where some residents oppose erecting of 

cell towers and government intervention of 
local economies
comissioner pai said one of our chal
lenges is showing the value of wireless inter
net based jobs to these small communities 

and nd ways that the fcc can make these 
transitions easier both men also voiced 
strong opposition to current plans for the 
fcc to take further control of the 
internet 
when asked by daines about the topic of 

net neutrality
one thing that surprised pai was also the 
amount of time it took to bring develop
ment to federally controlled areas versus 

privately controlled areas when it takes 
on average two years to get internet avail
able in privately controlled areas and four 
years to make it available in government 

controlled areas we should look for ways 
for the fcc to streamline that
later monday aernoon representatives 
from companies ranging from charter 
communications to the national asso
ciation of broadcasters talked about the 

continuing need to free up portions of the 

current wireless spectrum to make way 
for future technologies  peter davidson 
of verizon said that while current 4g 

technology is faster than previous tech
nologies it is already ve years old  
in order to compete with asian markets we 

need the government to bring more of the 

spectrum to industry for consumer benet 
said davidson  attendees estimated that 
the next generation of wireless technology 
would be up to 50 times faster than current 
4g systems

montanas wilderness is a fasci
nating research environment for 
those lucky enough to study it and 
cheyenne stirling became one of 
those fortunate scientists over the 

summer while researching bats in 
glacier national park
stirling a senior from shelby 
mont is majoring in sh and 

wildlife management and minor
ing in environmental horticulture 
she rst wanted to attend the 
university of montana but she 
was familiar with the school and 
she wanted to experience some
thing new 
i chose the adventure 

said stirling about her decision to 
attend msu
over the summer stirling 
had the opportunity to take her 
adventure beyond bozeman and 
into glacier national park where 
she conducted research on the 
roosting locations of bats stirling 

received the jerry oneal national 
park student fellowship a grant 
created for students to conduct 
studies in three areas of montana 
glacier national park grant
kohrs 
ranch national historic 
site or 
little bighorn battleeld 
national monument 
in glacier 
stirling worked with wildlife bi

ologist 
lisa bate e goal of stir
lings research was to gain an idea 

of the specic buildings and the 
types of buildings where bats are 
living in the park as preparation 
for whitenose syndrome wns 

a disease caused by the fungus 
pseudogymnoascus destructans to 
potentially reach montana 
if the 
fungus arrives my supervisor can 

go back through and look at my 
data and go to the exact building 
we need to check out stirling 
said
p destructans is a psychrophilic 
fungus which thrives in cold envi
ronments 
it aects bats during the 
winter while they are hibernating 

and do not have any expendable 
energy 
its a fungus that aects 
bats in hibernacula which is 
where all the bats stay together 
mostly in caves right now stirling 
explained ey y out and it just 
takes away from all their energy 
and the fungus starts to eat away 
at them 
it just sucks the life out 
of them ey havent found any 

way to cure it and theyre dying in 
masses   
stirling said that wns has 
nearly a 100 percent mortality rate 
in bats and while she originally 

did not have any interest in study
ing bats as she learned more about 

the virus she realized its impor
tance and pursued the topic she 

said that her research specically 
searching for the types of struc
tures where bats roost is the only 
research of its type being done in 
montana we need bats in our 
ecosystem 
stirling was surprised to learn 
that bats have an anity for tin 
roong and that it is dicult to 
detect bats in buildings she ex
plained that she spent a lot of time 
searching for bat feces most bat 
activity occurs at night and while 
stirling could only count up to 25 
bats in the daytime she was able to 
count 950 bats on the side of one 
building by doing an emergence 
count at night
stirlings experience with bats 
was a unique one she had to get a 

rabies vaccine but was then able to 

handle the bats through a process 
called mist netting wherein nets 
were set up around dusk until 
around two am bats ew into 

the nets and stirling could take 
them out and hold them stirlings 
favorite type of bat the hoarey 
bat is a so bat with a bearlike 
appearance that goes into torpor 
when it gets cold freezing when 
it ies into the mist net when 
youre taking them out of the net 
you think that you killed the bat 
but you warm them up by putting 
them in a bag and then putting 
them in your jacket and you can 
feel them moving and you can 

feel their heartbeat against yours 
stirling said 
its very interesting 
people dont get that close to spe
cies they do research on ever
stirlings summer experience 
in glacier included not only bat 
research but also bear sightings dur
ing various adventures 
i saw about 

15 bears over the summer and we 
almost hit a couple on our bikes 
she said stirlings favorite thing 
about being in glacier was exploring 
the beautiful backcountry
outside of academics stirling is 
an avid climber she was boulder
ing in joes valley utah during 
spring break when she applied for 
the jerry oneal fellowship stir
ling found out about the fellow
ship from one of her professors 

dr andrea 
litt aer graduating 
from msu this fall stirling would 
like to learn more about being 
a technician for research then 
eventually attend graduate school 

in the meantime she continues to 
analyze the research she collected 

over the summer as part of an 

independent study for credit at 
msu

exponentthe
its been a rough month for rap fans 
compton or no keith 
richards the 
legendary fossil and cofrontman of 
the 
rolling stones dismissed both artists 
and fans of the genre in an interview 
for the n
y daily news saying 
what rap did that was impres
sive was to show there are so 

many tonedeaf people out 

there he went on all they 
need is a drum beat and some
body yelling over it and theyre 
happy 
theres an enormous 
market for people who cant tell 

one note from another
this came shortly after news that rap
per 
tyler the creator was being denied 
entry to the uk for his scheduled tour 

according to his manager hes been 

banned from the country for three to 
five years 
the guardian reported that 
the uk government sent him a letter 
saying 
the home secretary has reached 
this decision because you have brought 

yourself within the scope of the list 

of unacceptable behaviour by making 
statements that may foster hatred which 
might lead to intercommunity violence 

in the uk
with these actions the 
richards and 
the home secretary have added their 
names to a long and undistinguished 
list of rap haters and its well past time 

the genre got some respect 
rap is not 
a spring chicken still wet behind the 

ears for context these baseless attacks 

are coming 42 years after dj kool herc 
started deejaying block parties 
its been 
40 years since dj grand wizard 
theo
dore accidentally invented the shigishi
gi of a disk jockeys scratch on a record 

he was trying to stop a record spinning 
so he could listen to his mother 36 
years since 
the sugarhill gangs 
rap
pers delight became the first rap hit
straight outta compton is older 
than some instructors on campus 
the 
chronic changed popular music forever 

before most coreclass enrollees were 

born and 
illmatic were it alive would 
be old enough to buy alcohol children 

born the day 
the notorious b
ig died 
are old enough to be freshmen here 

at msu and those born the day jay z 

released 
the blueprint can drive
simply put hiphop has been around 
long enough that it deserves respect 
it 
has established at this point that it is 

not a simple flash in the pan with roots 
going back far further than the term 
hiphop  coined by 
lovebug starski 
41 years ago  rap music has paid its 
dues and should be treated as a legiti

mate established art form
i can understand the urge 
to dismiss rap as musically 

simplistic or to look at some of 

the lyrics and conclude it poses 

a legitimate threat to the public 

welfare 
the genre certainly 
has its share of regrettable re
leases  from the disgustingly 

misogynistic or materialistic 
to the homophobic violent or simply 

stupid 
if all 
i listened to was the radio 
i would probably dismiss the genre too
that however would be as big a mis
take as judging all films by 
transform
ers or 
twilight or poohpoohing all 
books after reading 50 shades of grey 
or well 
twilight 
there are hundreds of albums with 
gorgeous production pete 
rock and c
l smooth dj premier and countless other 
hiphop producers have a long history 

of creating intricate tracks by combining 

samples and live recording  innovating 

techniques that are commonplace today
looking at the uks claims that 
tyler 
the creators lyrics pose a serious threat 

to the health of the country it is clear 

that the argument holds no water 
this 
is a case of antirap prejudices prevailing 

over any logical case
after all the artist had visited the uk 
for both pleasure and other tours numer
ous times since the offending songs were 

released  on 2009s mixtape goblin 

and 2011s 
tron cat  without inci
dent donald 
trumps antiimmigrant 
rhetoric meanwhile inspired two men 
in boston to attack a homeless man and 
yet remains cleared to land members of 

the westboro baptist church and the ku 

klux klan are allowed to fly to 
england 
and neonazi rallies take place in the 

streets clearly this is not actually about 

any legitimate fear a sixyearold song 

will incite hatred between communities
mr 
richards and the home secretary 
like an ignorant freshman are in dire 

need of a us 101 class 
there hopefully 
they could learn that there are multiple 

ways to look at a given issue and that 

just because they dont understand 

something doesnt mean it is not art
reading their comments its hard to 
keep lyrics from my mind more spe
cifically jay zs famous question from 

renegade do you fools listen to 
music or do you just skim through it

as of august over four million syr
ians have ed their country due to 
civil war with another estimated 65 
million people displaced within the country 

ese numbers equate to almost 60 percent of 

syrians having been forced out of their homes 

at this time the conict is only get
ting worse and world governments 

are not doing enough to help
when the arab spring began 
back in 2011 a resistance move
ment against syrian president 

bashir alassad began and quickly 

devolved into a complicated web of 

rebel and proassad factions vying 

for power many syrians ed their 

country in the wake of all the turmoil and 

upheaval 
e refugee crisis ramped up signicantly 
two years ago when the 
islamic state became 
prominent in the northeastern part of the 

country a region also known as the 
levant 
e islamic state is a group whose goal is to 
reinstate the 
islamic caliphate but unfortu
nately strays from 
islams messages of peace in 
favor of a militaristic police state e 
islamic 
states medieval tactics in maintaining power 

have have caused even more upheaval in the 

region and in just the last two years leading 

to over one million eeing the nation and ve 

million displaced 
refugees are becoming a controversial issue 
in 
europe because governments 
are starting to simply say they dont 

want any more people nations are 

doing everything they can to keep 

them out at this point and under 

the dublin 
regulation countries 
have the right to send back any 

refugee who illegally crosses their 

borders 
even worse nations like 
hungary have simply stopped ac
cepting applications for asylum 
on sept 2 an image went viral of three
yearold syrian aylan kurdi washed up on a 

turkish beach aer drowning in an attempt 
to sail with 1800 other migrants to greece 

syrians are having their homes destroyed and 

now in 
europe people arent giving them the 
chance for a new home
westerners 
  
 americans in particular  
cant imagine what its like having this kind 
of devastation and upheaval brought to their 

nation some people in 
europe still remember 
the devastation of ww
ii
 but a bloody con
ict hasnt torn apart america recently enough 

for this generation of americans to remember 

e americans who are updated on the crisis 

in the middle 
east oen dont have any new 
solutions for the issue many think those 

people want the us to come in and bomb 

the bad guys until they stop killing each 

other americans should have learned by now 

that bombing in the middle 
east will only per
petuate the cycle of violence and increase the 

antiwestern sentiments there what the syr
ian people want is not more war or violence 

but peace and stability  something that us 

americans have been taking for granted 
people ee their nation to get away from 
the violence some might say theyre not 

doing their duty to their country by running 

away but ask yourself what can they do 

e average civilian cant do much to save 

their nation and stop the violence if so many 

of them dont have basic needs met or even 

have homes to live in at this point they dont 

even have a country to ght for as the nation 
has been split into assads fascist regime the 

islamic state and countless other small fac
tions 
its a messy and devastating conict that 
is getting a lot of people killed for backwards 

idealism and western nations are starting 

to turn away these people who dont have 

anywhere else to turn to 
even small things can make a dierence to 
people so devastated and msu students can 

help through groups that are doing all they 

can to aid these displaced syrians e us

based karam foundation is trying to provide 

education for the refugees in 
turkey as well 
as rebuilding schools in syria e migrant 

oshore aid station exists to raise funds in 

aid of refugees eeing by boat and can help 

prevent tragedies like aylan kurdi lifelessly 

washing ashore while trying to ee to safety 

and lastly hand in hand for syria is a group 

that actually takes all the money donated to 

the ground in syria trying to help the 65 mil
lion displaced by the conict so far college 

students arent usually the rst ones to donate 

money but please just ask yourself what you 

would hope for if this was happening to your 

country and your people

  9video games are a thriving indus
try video game consoles and pcs 

are as common in households as 
toasters and microwaves according to 

the 
entertainment software 
rating board 
esrb the video game industry pulls 
in tens of billions of dollars per 

year in revenue which continues 

to increase as the cost of gaming 

rises however the video game 

industry is not alone in making 

money video game consumers 

have established a means of cash
ing in on these sales merely by 

playing the games they purchase
through a live streaming 
video platform known as 
twitchtv
 simply 
referred to as 
twitch gamers are able to 
broadcast their gameplay to the public 

the setup is free anyone interested in 
live streaming their gameplay creates a 

profile and channel through the 
twitchtv
 site or app and joins their 
twitch account 
with their gaming source as 
twitch 
streamers gain popularity they increase 

their chances to earn money how much 

money 
enough to turn playing video 
games into a fulltime job if they have the 

dedication
ere are several ways in which stream
ers are able earn money 
two of the more 
common means are through advertise
ments and donations 
yes donations 
twitch channel viewers regularly submit 
donations through the site in support 

of the broadcasters they follow ough 

common donations range from 1 to 50 

some of the more popular streamers make 

upwards of 1500 per month from dona
tions alone e most nancially successful 

streamers on 
twitch are partners with the 
company besides donations and advertis

ing 
twitch partners gain a signicant 
amount of their income through subscrib
ers a subscription costs 5 which 
twitch 
splits paying the streaming partner 2 

however to apply for partnership one 

must average at least 500 simultaneous 

views per broadcast at least three days per 

week 
youtube broadcasters who average 
at least 15000 views per video with at 

least 100000 subscribers are also consid
ered so in order to really make prot 

popularity is a must nonetheless there 

are numerous ways to make a prot out
side of partnership such as selling tshirts 

on which your gaming logo is printed 

again this brings up the question of just 

how much money can be made
twitch averages over 100 million 
viewers each month according the wall 

street journal 
in its four years of exis
tence 
twitch managed to become the 
fourth largest source of internet traffic 

in the united states 
the game stream
ing market is growing so rapidly 

that amazoncom paid nearly 

1 billion to acquire 
twitch 
with an already large and ever 

growing viewer base there is 

a lot of financial opportunity 

for companies and streamers 

alike although 
twitch does not 
release the financial statistics 

behind streaming several top 
streamers have been interviewed provid
ing some insight into just how much some 

people are being paid to play 
taking into 
account every component of their gaming 

income some streamers estimate their 

incomes at over 200000 per year
is it morally and ethically appropri
ate to accept donations just for playing 

video games perhaps the better question 

is whether it is morally and ethically 

acceptable to donate money to gamers 
i believe the answer is yes 
i feel that these 

streamers are providing a form of enter
tainment to an audience many viewers 

donate and subscribe for advice while 

others donate as fans 
these donations 
are no different than tips paid to anyone 

else performing a service besides what is 

the difference between paying to watch a 

video game match and paying for a pay

perview mixed martial arts match
there is a lot that can be said about 
todays gamers while some casually 

spend time entertaining themselves oth
ers appear to be addicts however gamers 

are perceived more and more are train
ing themselves in a future career whether 

purposefully or inadvertently with such 

a large amount of viewers and broad
casters and an equally large fan base it 

is only a matter of time before gaming 

is publicly regarded as a sport we may 

someday see video game broadcasts 

right alongside poker on 
espn after
all streamers have adoring fans they 

sell merchandise they compete against 

one another in front of large audiences 

and they are being paid based on their 

popularity so the next individual you 

see intensely sweating over a keyboard 

or holding a controller with cool ranch 

stained fingertips could be the next top 

athlete which is great by me

dean of the library kenning arlitsch played a primary role in 
aquiring the doig collection
dean of letters and science nicol rae helped in the acquisition 
of the doig collection
on yellow legal pads  he would write ideas phrases and 
quotes on these big index cards and then start to type out 
his manuscript  his entire writing process is laid out and i 
think that this is what will be interesting to scholars who are 
interested in doig how did he write what was his process 
what were his ideas what were the things that didnt make 
it into the book
e collection also includes boxes of correspondence that 
doig had with people who wrote to him and speeches that 
he gave including a friends of the library speech he gave at 
msu in 2010
e librarys plan is to outsource the digitization of the 
collection to a specialist company in order to nish the task 
on schedule in the proposal to carol doig the library had 
promised to have 90 percent of the collection posted online 
within eight months of receiving it
both rae and arlitsch are excited about the opportunities 
the collection will provide for msu students and scholars 
of doig while there are no concrete plans for the use of 
the collection some potential uses detailed in the proposal 
include incorporating the collection into undergraduate and 
graduate syllabi for american studies english geography 
and history within 12 months and developing soware 
applications to help students and scholars within 24 months 
such proposed applications include crowdsourced annota
tions of doigs manuscripts and using interviews and cor
respondences with doig to show his inuence over time
since i have come here i have been trying to push something 
called digital scholarship  sometimes it is referred to as 
digital humanities arlitsch said e idea is that if you 
digitize a mass of documents like this  you can do things 
with it that you couldnt do with paper documents you can 
si through and synthesize and analyze  theres a lot that 
you can do with digital scholarship applications that you 
cannot do with just a print collection
rae added that the college of letters and science intends 
to organize and hold a conference to honor doig and his 
work in the fall of 2017 e conference would be as open 
to the public as possible and would serve as opportunity to 
bring scholars and writers to msu while acknowledging 
doigs memory
is is my biggest contribution to the project i think it 
would be great to do a scholarly conference on ivan doig 
once we have the papers i anticipate we could do it in the 
fall of 2017 and i will nd the funding for that one way 
or another i think it would be a good opportunity to bring 
some leading western writers and scholars of the west and 
western literature to msu and to showcase some of our own 
very strong faculty and students in that same area  ats 
my part of the deal well do it and i think we can put a very 
neat event together here in bozeman rae said
now that doigs collection has found a home at msu both 
rae and arlitsch hope students will be able to appreciate and 
use the new resource available to them
i think that this is not only for students who grew up in 
montana but for any students who are studying at msu 
is is about as close to home as it gets and i hope that 
students will take an opportunity to come in and sit with 
the material in special collections and look through some of 
it and interact with it on the web and through the digital 
scholarship applications we are going to createarlitsch said 
i think that students do not always realize what treasures 
they have here and this is denitely a treasure they should 
take advantage of
the acquisition of ivan doigs papers mark a new page 
in the history of montana state university we are 
absolutely thrilled and committed to be careful stewards of 
the doig archive montana state university will treat these 
materials with the utmost care and respect while making 
them widely available to students scholars and the global 
community both in their print formats and through digiti
zation and the accessibility of internet search engines msu 
president waded cruzado said
she continued our landgrant mission of teaching 
research and outreach make montana state the natural 
partner for a man whose life and work is deeply tied to 
our state our historical commitment to educating the 
sons and daughters of the working families of america is 
clearly captured in ivans writings representing the lives and 
tribulations of ordinary people in rural montana is is a 
marriage made in big sky heaven
doig was an acclaimed writer and novelist who also had 
considerable experience as a journalist born in white 
sulphur springs mont doig grew up along the rocky 
mountain front aer graduating from valier high 
school he attended northwestern university and received 
bachelors and masters degrees in journalism e 17 books 
he penned were oen set in the historic landscapes of his 
childhood doig passed away at 75 years old in seattle 
wash this past april
acquiring the doig collection was spearheaded by kenning 
arlitsch dean of the msu library and nicol rae dean of 
the college of letters and science both were enthusiastic 
about the chance to bring doigs work to msu
i think its a recognition of our reputation as a center of 
excellence for the study of the west  we have scientists 
working on issues important to the west we have histori
ans on our faculty and graduate students who work on the 
history of the west we have scholars of western literature 
and social scientists who work on the region rae said 
i think getting the doig papers is a recognition of that 
second it shows our commitment to the humanities that 
we are committed to that area as well as the sciences
ivan doig was a writer who was very much attached to 
this part of montana  most of what he wrote about took 
place along the rocky mountain front along the bridger 
mountains and so forth so hes very rooted in this area 
said arlitsch who initially approached doigs widow carol 
from that perspective alone bringing his papers back to the 
institution thats located in this area makes the most sense
according to arlitsch doig employed an archivist to help 
him organize his materials before he passed away e 
archivist sent him an inventory of the collection in july 
and along with the associate dean of the library brian 
rossman ew to seattle in august to visit with carol and 
look at the collection before returning to bozeman where 
they spent a week preparing a proposal
e proposal was developed collaboratively by msus library 
and the college of letters and science and backed by msu 
faculty as well as local writers and community members in 
total 26 individuals provided letters of support including 
president cruzado msu writerinresidence rick bass and 
red ants pants owner sarah calhoun aer support was 
secured the proposal was sent to carol she liked what she 
saw said arlitsch and msus proposal was accepted
carol really liked what we proposed because her and 
ivans primary motivation was that this collection get out to 
the public and be used by the public students and scholars 
said arlitsch a lot of times when collections come into 
archives it takes a long time for them to see the light of day 
it can takes years before anything becomes available so we 
are trying to be very aggressive with this in getting it out as 
quickly as possible and i think that really appealed to her
arlitsch explained that while the bulk of the collection is 
paper documents it also includes audio and slide collections
for instance when he was writing this house of 
sky he went back to the white sulphur springs area in 
ringling and he interviewed a number of his old neigh
bors and he recorded all those interviews on audiocas
settes arlitsch said
describing the collection as very complete arlitsch said 
the documents showcase doigs writing process in its entirety 
he was a meticulous writer and he was a very process 
oriented writer he would write out what his ideas were for 
books  what the title would be and how many words that 
he thought the book would be he would start to take notes

i think that this is not only for students who grew up in montana but for any 
students who are studying at msu this is about as close to home as it getsi 
think that students do not always realize what treasures they have here and 
this is denitely a treasure they should take advantage of  kenning arlitsch
e collected works and writings of late author and montanaborn ivan doig have found a permanent home at msu displaying msus dedi
cation to expanding its commitment to the humanities msu faculty hope that the collection will enhance educational and research opportunities 
for students and scholars comprised of doigs notes manuscripts and correspondences over the years the collection will soon become available in 
its entirety in digital format for students and fans of doig around the world to peruse and study

in the rst set before the 
redhawks took 
the lead at 2019 e two teams were tied 
eight times before the 
redhawks edged 
out a 3028 victory 
e bobcats rebounded from the close 
set to take command of the second set

red
hawks came back outhitting the bobcats 

and winning the set 2522 
in the deciding 
set the 
redhawks closed out the game by a

we felt like the team put together a re
ally good complete match in the sense that 

we did some good things from a volleyball 
perspective as well as competed at a high 
level we denitely put ourselves in a posi
tion to win that match but had some un
timely errors msu head coach jj 
riley 
said junior 
loni kreun led the bobcats in 
kills with 20 and sophomore kasey altman 
led in digs with 23 
i think the beauty of 
the match was there were many athletes 

that contributed and put up some good 

numbers 
riley said we had ve athletes 
with doubledigit kills and as well as four 

athletes with doubledigit digs
msu went on to face the university of 
nevada on saturday and lost three sets to 

none e biggest thing we can take away 

from nevada is for everyone including my
self to reect on our preparation leading up 

to that morning match and see if there are 

things that we could have done dierently 

to get the team going 
riley said we 
just seemed really at and had a hard time 
cranking it up as the match went on 
e cats held a 2422 lead in the rst set 
but the wolf pack rattled o four unan
swered points to take a 2624 victory 
in the second and third sets the bobcats were 
outhit 210 to 000 as they fell to scores of 

2519 and 2515 kreun led the bobcats in 

kills with 10 and freshman katie 
ireland 
led msu in digs e biggest focus leav
ing the locker room was that we leave as a 

unied group supporting each other and 

hungry to keep improving 
riley said
e bobcats will travel to colorado 
springs to play the united states air force 

academy on ursday sept 17 ese 

next couple of days we are just going to 

keep focusing on our vision and big picture 

which is training the fundamentals of the 

game being a great team staying intense 
and pushing ourselves to keep learning how 
to see the game 
riley said we will work 
on some things specically to help us be 
ready for air force from a defensive and 

oensive standpoint but our big focus is on 

the whole season and things that we need to 

keep learning for conference play

sursday september 17 2015
by will hamelin a way we had gotten exactly what we 
wished for at wasnt comforting for us 
as in retrospect the eight hour 500 mile 
journey from chester to cheney was go
ing to seem longer on the way back
sitting in the end zone seating of 
eastern washingtons 
ross field in 2005 
before it was painted red to resemble an 

exodusera nile 
river we quietly mused 
amongst ourselves how nice it would be 

if the two teams managed to play most 
of the games action near our seats aer 
such a long journey dad michael and 
i were thrilled as happy as we were to be 
there with the idea of squinting to com
prehend the action downeld is was to 

be a pivotal matchup as this was eective
ly an elimination game for both schools 
e game featured two of the conferences 

most accomplished quarterbacks seniors 
travis 
lulay and 
erik meyer of montana 
state and 
eastern washington respec
tively
e pregame hoopla turned out to be all 
for naught as the 
eagles gave us exactly 
what we had asked for aer the bobcats 
scored the games opening touchdown at 

the far end zone to begin the 2nd quarter 

the 
eagles scored ve unanswered touch
downs right in our end zone eectively 
turning what had been such a hyped game 
into a bloodbath not dissimilar to the 

color of the current eld winning 3514 

is game eectively set the end date for 
the 
lulay era as the cats were able to 
salvage the season with a victory over the 
griz to end the season but missed the 

playos as a result of their loss in cheney
it is games like this that underscore 
the underappreciated rivalry between 
the cats and the 
eagles both schools 
recognize this which is why they are play
ing each other this saturday in cheney in 
what will technically be a nonconference 

matchup with the 2012 additions of 

north dakota southern utah calpoly 

and uc davis the big sky conference 

had a daunting task with its 13member 

conference ey had to ensure nearequal 
playing opportunities against all confer
ence opponents while trying to preserve 
the conferences historic rivalries 
as a result the big sky set up a league 
schedule where each team would play two 

conference rivals every year and rotate 

conference opponents for the remaining 

six games is system was not embraced 

by all notably bobcat head coach 
rob 
ash as a number of rivalry games would 
be lost e cats were obviously paired 
with the griz there would have been 
a riot otherwise but the university of 

north dakota was rather lonely over in 

eastern north dakota and the bobcats 

were the natural choice to be one of their 

rivals the other is northern colorado 

in turn montana states less celebrated 
rivalries with fellow conference founders 

idaho state and weber state were lost
yet 
eastern washington also saw t 
as the cats did to continue their young 
unique rivalry from a practical stand
point it certainly makes sense the 
majority of fcs schools west of the 
mississippi are big sky members and 

nonconference opponents are hard to 

schedule 
but for the bobcats playing the 
eagles 
has been a dicult experience e cats 

are 210 against the 
eagles since 2003 
1028 overall e last three games have 

been especially cruel to the cats ere 

was 2012 when the cats thoroughly out
played the 
eagles but were on the wrong 
end of a 2724 score thanks to a blocked 

punt and interception both of which were 

returned for touchdowns ere was 2013 

when the 
eagles oense led by vernon 
adams now with oregon scored a 

touchdown on literally every possession in 

a 5429 
eagles victory ere was last year 
when the bobcats surprisingly had the 
eagles on the ropes late in the 4th quarter 
with a fourth and ten a stop would have 

won the game but adams completed a 
40yard pass that led to the touchdown 

and gamewinning two point conversion
but no matchup was as gut wrench
ing as 2004 similar to 2005 both teams 

were playing in an elimination game but 

the bobcats had the 3110 early in the 

3rd quarter e 
eagles rallied and tied 
the game at 37 but 
lulay and the cats 
responded with the goahead touchdown 
with 117 le is was enough time for 
the 
eagles to tie the game and win in 
overtime eliminating the cats from play
o contention
despite these setbacks one of the 
bobcats most memorable wins in recent 
memory came against the 
eagles in 2010 
denarius mcghees freshman year e 

cats excised the demons of the then seven 
game losing streak and put together argu
ably the most complete performance seen 

at bobcat stadium over the past years de
feating the 
eagles 347 unfortunately the 
cats national championship hopes ended 
prematurely and the national champion
ship was won  by the 
eagles
is year the cats have reason to be 
optimistic e cats highying of
fense that went poundforpound with 
the 
eagles last year returns nearly all of 
their starters e cats defense may be 
what decides the game as nearly all of the 

starters from last years 119th out of 121 
ranked pass defense graduated with their 
quarterback transferred to oregon the 
eagles are 02 though those losses came 
at fbs powerhouse oregon and at fcs 
powerhouse northern 
iowa respectable 
losses all things considered  
eastern 
washingtons wide receiver cooper kupp 

the big skys preseason oensive mvp 
will be a considerable test for the bobcats 

young defense
despite the heartbreaking losses and 
setbacks it is important that the cats and 
eagles keep their rivalry alive by sched
uling nonconference games like these 
especially in an age where conference 
realignment has ended many of college 
footballs storied rivalries hopefully this 

time around we will truly get what we 
wish for
eastern washington university the unsung rivalry
this year the cats have reason to be optimistic the cats 
highying offense that went poundforpound with the 
eagles last year returns nearly all of their starters

rf over the course of the next 
week youre probably going to see 
a bunch of people with bandanas 

around their head sprinting around 
campus attacking people and 
people with bandanas around 

their arms carrying nerf guns and 

wadded socks or marshmallows 

although it may not seem like it 
there is no need to be worried is 
chaotic activity is under control 

all of these people are playing in 
a weeklong game that happens 
each semester called humans vs 

zombies 
humans vs zombies is basically 
just a weeklong 247 game of 

tag said vice president daphne 

carlson as long as you are out
side you can get tagged weve had 
people go to 
yellowstone with their 
friends forgetting about the game 
and get tagged there e entire 
purpose of the game is to survive 
e zombies purpose is to make 

sure the you dont
zombies start to work as teams 
really well eyll eventually start 

texting each other locations of where 
they found humans and a gang of 
them will nd the human and tag 
him e humans have to paying 
attention 
if not they will die
e campuswide game is huge 
usually ranging from about 200

500 players on average there is 

usually one zombie for every 40 

players is may not seem like a 

lot but by around the third day of 

humans vs zombies the zombies 

always seem to outnumber the 
humans
e base rules for humans vs 
zombies are simple 
each human 
starts with a headband around their 
arm and each zombie starts with 

a headband around their head 
if you are tagged by a zombie you 

become a zombie and have to put 

your headband around your head 

e zombies arent allowed to 
carry any sort of weapons eir 
only way to kill a someone is to tag 

them however the humans are al
lowed to carry a whole assortment 

of weapons including nerf guns 
which have to be brightly colored 
for safety reasons 
we have had people in the past 
have dark colored guns and it really 

caused some scary moments as they 

sometimes looked like real guns 
and we dont want people to look 
like theyre shooting real guns at 
other people carlson said 
its 
just easier if you can get a brightly 
colored gun at wont cause 
alarm
if you dont feel like going out 
and spending 20 on a nerf gun 

you dont have to humans are also 
allowed to have marshmallows 
or socks that they can throw at 
people 
if a zombie is hit they are 
stunned for 15 minutes so the 
humans can get away to safety 
as a human you are only allowed 
to be tagged outside ere is also 
a 10foot safe zone radius around 
all of the buildings to avoid people 
crashing into buildings and hurting 

themselves when you join as a 
human you are given a number 
when you are tagged you have to 
give your number to the zombie 
that tagged you so they can enter it 

in the computer to register you as a 
zombie in the overall system 
e most important rule of all is 
simple dont be a jerk 
its really 
easy to get caught up in the mo
ment carlson said e chases 
can get intense and people some
times get tackled 
if you get tackled 
by a zombie and he demands your 

registration number you are al
lowed to stand up brush yourself 

o and be like dude you were a 

total jerk thats breaking the rules 

im not giving you my number e 
ultimate goal of the game is to have 

fun 
if youre being a jerk nobody is 
having fun and that just defeats the 

purpose
staying cooped up inside isnt 
a legitimate strategy either 
every 
night there is a mission all of the 

humans are encouraged to do is 

is where most of the fun comes 

from in humans vs zombies  
apart from having fun carlson 
said its a great way to meet people 

when 
i rst came to college 

i didnt really know anyone 
i 
decided to do humans vs zombies 

and i met so many people so many 

of them have stayed my friends 

since 
i got here 
it was one of the 
best things 
ive done
every year its chaotic fun for 
everyone participating 
its a great 
way to meet people and a fun

embracing identity 
part one
by kaycee cr
onkpitch perfect 2
as acaawesome as the first installment 
nah but its not acatastrophe either 
after a disastrous performance in front of 

the president that leads to their disband
ment the barden bellas seek redemption 

at an international acapella competition 
this lends pitch perfect 2 some genu
inely impressive moments in the form of 

acapella performances from around the 
world 
there are also some pretty good 
laughs including an underground com
petition featuring the green bay pack
ers however the introduction of hailee 

steinfelds character 
emily feels forced 
and awkward and out of the movies al
ready too numerous side stories hers is the 

most annoying but whatever  theres 
girl power good songs and those two 
acacommentators 
elizabeth banks and 
john michael higgins are always good 

for a laugh pitch perfect 2 will leave you 

chuckling at least 30 percent of the time 
which is more than your calc homework 
can say
jurassic world
see this in theaters while you still can  
if youre watching a 
trex scamper across 
your laptop screen youre doing it wrong 
is is a movie made for the big screen as 
per jurassic tradition the eects are larger 
than life and if you cant fully appreciate 
them you might end up questioning the 
plot and oh boy if that happens its all 

downhill from there 
as you might have heard in the trailers 
the park is open and millions of people 

ood to it each year however a geneti
callyengineered highly intelligent terror 

manages to escape from her enclosure and 
goes on a ferocious killing spree nothing 
wrong with that  who doesnt love seeing 

people getting swallowed whole by dino
saurs  where jurassic world gets hung 

up is in the human aspects of the lm most 
of which are encompassed by dull clichs  
a workaholic aunt sheds her cold persona 

to save her nephews snooze a romance 
blooms between an aable dino wrangler 
and a rather unlikeable scientist ugh 
ese criticisms aside jurassic world is 
still worth seeing eres something to be 

said for a movie that is so entertaining you 
completely forget how dumb it is 
spy
every inch of this lm is amazing with 
paul feig bridesmaids e heat at 
the reigns and melissa mccarthy in tow 
you know its going to be good mccarthy 

stars as susan cooper a c
ia analyst who 
goes undercover to prevent the sale of a 
deadly weapon to an even deadlier arms 
dealer but though susan is inexperienced 
she is denitely not inept and a lot of the 
satisfaction of spy derives from watch
ing susan outsmart the villains and peers 

who continually underestimate her 
its also 
completely hilarious 
mccarthy as usual is game for anything 
and hits jokes out of the park like the co
medic allstar she is however the funniest 

part of this lm  and prepare yourself for 

this one  is jason statham whos mostly 

known for bland action thrillers playing 

rick ford a viciously quotable eld agent 
statham infuses every ridiculous line with so 

much arrogance and fervor hes reminiscent 
of a rather egotistical but innitely funnier 
james bond spy is a mustsee for all fans of 

laughing see it as soon as you can
procrastinatorpreviewin a time when laws surrounding 
the lesbian gay and bisexual 
lgb 
community are becoming clearer 
granting the community greater social 

and legal standing the transgender 
community continues to lag behind 
in recognition and legal protection
transgender is an umbrella term 
encompassing those who do not 

identify with their biological sex 
it 
includes such identications as trans
sexual transgender identiers who 

surgically change their sex agender 
androgynous intersex cross dresser 
and many others cassidy medicine 

horse a local writer and activist 
as well as founder of 
transmsu 
 a support group for transgender 
students  dened transgender as a 
personal understanding of who you 
are as a gendered individual that is not 

limited by the biological and social 
imperatives associated with ones 
birth self recognition as gay lesbian 
or bisexual addresses sexual predispo
sition self recognition as transgender 
is a declaration of selood
e trans community does not 
have the protection oered by hate 

crime laws hate crimes include sin
gling someone out based on race eth
nicity sexuality and other prejudices 

medicine horse mentioned that 
legislation is being introduced in the 
next year that would stop discrimina
tion on the basis of gender presenta
tion or identity nationwide
many however do not take trans 
violence seriously even where it is 
against the law medicine horse 
stated the reality is how laws are 
enforced is of equal importance as to 

what the law is and it doesnt help 
that the trans community is the mar
ginalized of the marginalized while 
the 
lgb community is pushed to the 
side less oen the trans community 

continues to be ignored and silenced
while lesbian gay bisexual and 
transgender 
lgb
t people are 
all included within one acronym 

transgender diers from 
lgb in that 
its the only one of the four that relates 
to gendered identity of the self not 
sexual attraction medicine horse 

commented the 
t in 
lgb
t got 
tacked on as an aerthought e 

singular commonality between 
lgb 
and 
t is that none are products of 

choice
aer her own transition medi
cine horse lost lifelong friends she 

believes people use labels because 

theyre easy and become uncomfort
able when others change and leave 

their designated boxes ey toss 

them out as mistakes rather than 
simply expanding the box theyve 
made medicine horse desires a box 

that just says human build on that 
accept that 
youre human with all 
the innuendos and additions and 
subtractions and wonderful things 
and horrible things that that term 
involves and thats okay
when asked what advice she would 
give to those considering transition 

medicine horse said be very sure of 
what youre doing go very slow think 

it through ere is nothing easy 
about it 
transitioning is dicult 
expensive and you will lose friends 

though you may nd others in un
likely places medicine horse advised 
reading doing your own research and 
talking to those who have transi
tioned themselves 
you cannot do it 
by yourself she stated that whatever 

is going on whatever problems you 
have changing gender will not cure 

that ose problems are still going 
to be with you just because you tran
sition gender doesnt mean you have 
this instantaneous cure for all those 
problems
in discussing her own transition 
medicine horse said shes much hap
pier now whatever was happening 
before her transition there was always 

a sadness a heartache she is now 

completely comfortable in her own 

skin someones advice to her was to 

be comfortable being who she is that 

she has to own it
to those who value the designated 
boxes medicine horse said the only 

box we t into is human stop trying 

to put trans people in your box and 

then wonder why they dont t

skent davis a msu professor author 
and improvisational actor is releasing 
his debut novel a 
riddle in 
ruby on 

sept 22 
last saturday he directed two 

events for the montana book festival 

in missoula an idea hunting workshop 

for kids ages 812 and a 
young adult 
fantasy panel in which he discussed his 

writing process and led a worldbuilding 

exercise with three other authors
during the idea hunting workshop at 
the missoula public 
library davis led 
the kids through his 
yes and impro
visational exercise 
yes and is a popular 
idea from improvisation practices 

urging participants to say yes to ev
erything and add something else to the 

story davis has used the exercise and 

taught 
yes and in his honors college 
seminar courses 
in daviss book festival exercise he 
used this practice to help the kids create 

a story idea starting simply with any 

object in their homes one child chose a 

mushroom another chose a toothbrush 

then davis asked the kids to make 
the object magic create someone who 

wants to steal it and create a side kick 

participants left the workshop with 

an outline complete with protagonist 

antagonist and conflict  the classic 

elements of a story
daviss own novel was fashioned simi
larly 
i think 
yes and makes things 
easier you dont have to have a fully 

formed idea to move on for example 

with this book 
i didnt have to just 

write it straight through 
i could work 

my way through it 
i dont think how 

do i get to the very end of this 
i just 

think whats the next step
it started with a girl with a tri
corne hat in a barrel with metal ostrich 
legs 
that image popped into my head 
and then the world of 
the chemystral 
age came tumbling after davis said 
interestingly enough that girl in that 
barrel she isnt 
ruby her storys still 

out there
a 
riddle in 
ruby is the first in a 
young adult trilogy davis said hes been 
working on the upcoming second novel 
for the past nine months and expects a 
finished project in about 
four months
the novel and the 
upcoming fantasy series 

come complete with 
alchemists antique locks 
and keys and pirates 
kirkus 
reviews sum
marized it 
this tale 
of revolutionary intent 

selfdiscovery and doublecrossing cross
dressing is worth the trip

five on black brings brazilian twist to bozeman
by 
cono
r 
gle
sneris past june bozeman welcomed a new 
restaurant to the downtown area  the 
brazilian grill five on black e restau
rant is actually the second in a small chain 
that started in missoula e original was 

founded by university of montana alumni 

tom snyder who was inspired to open the 
grill aer visiting brazil using money he 

won in a university of montana school of 

business administration contest e origi
nal five on black opened in missoula in 
april 2015 and has seen enormous success 
since leading to their expansion into boze
man and the planned opening of a third 

restaurant in missoula is success could 

partly stem from the grills combination of 

aordability and unique food                     
brazilian food is rare in bozeman so a 
visit to five on black is by default a unique 
culinary experience e menu allows you 
to build bowls from a variety of dierent 

options e process starts with a choice 

of white rice brown rice or crisp greens 

en there is a choice of proteins  beef 

chicken tilapia roasted veggies or feijoada 

a traditional brazilian stew consisting of 

pork and beans next is a selection of side 

dishes including coconut sweet potatoes 

steamed collard greens or black beans aer 

that are the sauces  mango bbq or spicy 

coconut and nally a combination of up 

to three toppings which include chunky 

tomato vinaigrette farofa a toasted our 

mixture made from the cassava root lime 

wedge spicy chimichurri or cilantro for an 

extra 50 cents it is also possible to add a pao 

de queijo a kind of brazilian cheese bread
e variety on the menu allows for a wide 
gamut of avors and combinations that 

result in a unique tasty dish  my rst visit 

i had a white rice bowl with tilapia coco
nut sweet potatoes spicy 

coconut sauce farofa spicy 

chimichurri and cilantro 
i am always skeptical when 

i approach a dish that ap
pears to be so convoluted 

but it surprised me by 

simultaneously maintain
ing all of its separate 

robust avors and creating an unprecedented 

taste all its own a single bowl can be spicy 

sweet smoky and savory all at the same time 

it speaks volumes about a restaurant when 
there are so many ingredients in a dish and 

they all retain their unique avors five on 

black accomplishes this and takes it a step 

further by making sure that all of the ingre
dients are in harmony and produce a great 
result no matter the combination
and not only is the food good its also 
oered at a very reasonable price start
ing at 575 for a small bowl and ranging 
to 875 for a large is is great food for 

a student budget e service is also fast 
and the bowls can be 

eaten onthego easily 

another important point 

is that the grill ts in the 

atmosphere of downtown 

bozeman 
it is a small 
business opened by a 
young entrepreneur and 
owes its success entirely 
to the creativity of its design and and the 

eectiveness of its products great food 

great atmosphere and a great story five on 

black should continue to be successful in 

the future

simeniuk made a statement that 
she would resign from office 

effective oct 1 in a letter ad
dressed to the students of msu 

this announcement comes in the 
wake of controversy following 
her dui charge and subsequent 

censuring by the asmsu senate
simeniuk explained that she 
decisided to resign when she 

realized it was a necessary action 

to help the campus and student 

community move forward its 

something i have been consider
ing for a while obviously it was 

one of my options but my deci

sion became a lot more serious 
this past weekend i know that 
there were groups of students 

mobilized with petitions for 

recall and i do not think that it 

is fair to drag asmsu through a 

recall election 
she continued at that point 
i thought it was best for me to 

step back so that asmsu could 
actually focus on other impor
tant student issues that are going 
on simeniuk said i think that 

this has received a lot of atten
tion and i think we need to move 

forward and i think students 

need to be able to put their faith 

into asmsu and i am not sure 
they will be able to do that col
lectively if i am still here
dean of students matt caires 
commented on simeniuks 
decision saying i respect 

gwynns decision to step down 

as asmsu president  i believe 

this entire situation has been a 

series of important lessons and 

discussions for our students  
and i think that this work in 
front of the asmsu student 

senate needs to continue i hope 

that they are ready to take the 

next step by defining conduct 

standards and expectations for 

elected and appointed asmsu 
student leaders within their 
working documents 
looking to the future of 
asmsu simeniuk affirmed her 

confidence in the abilities of cur
rent asmsu vice president levi 

birky as he steps up to president 
as well as those members of 
the asmsu senate in moving 
forward and accomplishing the 

goals she and birky originally 

campaigned for simeniuk hopes 

that the current controversy will 

not hinder asmsus work
i am disappointed that the 
whole situation overshadowed a 

lot of the good things we could 

do but i think by stepping back 

we can move forward again and 

accomplish those things  my 

biggest worry is that with any
thing we try and move forward 

with students may not have 

faith that asmsu has their best 

interests at heart i want students 

to have faith in this organization 

because we can do so much 
simeniuk said
though she will no longer be 
serving in asmsu simeniuk 
intends to continue her campus 

involvement she said one of 

the issues i would like to focus 

on is revising the academic 

calendar i am going to be sitting 

on a task force not necessarily 
representing asmsu but a task 
force for revising the academic 

calendar the administration 

wants student input so levi and 

i will both be working on that 

i am also still committed to im
proving our campus spirit and i 

feel like i dont have to be in this 
role to do that
simeniuk concluced by saying 
i think the takeaway from this 
is that i am very ashamed of my 

actions but i am not ashamed of 

myself since that night when i 

received my charge i think i have 

handled the situation to the best 

of my ability
i had humility in the situ
ation and i feel at peace that i 

was honest about the situation 

and that i didnt try to hide it 

i could have and i knew there 

would be a lot consequences in 

sharing it with the public but i 

think i handled it in the best way 
that i could have i am not giving 
up i am disappointed that i do 

have to step back but i do not 

feel like i am giving up i am still 

committed to improving student 

engagements and to the success 

of msu
dear students of montana state university
over the past few weeks there has been much discussion about me remaining as asmsu 
president or stepping down from this office i greatly appreciate and respect those who have 
expressed their opinion directly to me and their student leaders i sincerely appreciate the 
feedback and support that i have received from my fellow students as well as those in the greater 
msu community 
i am impressed with our students taking this issue seriously it is plain that students recognize that 
this is an important issue to discuss but i hope students also realize that there are other important 
issues concerning students on our campus i also hope that this does not overshadow the positive 
work being done by asmsu on the homecoming ballot students will be able to vote on the 
revised constitution as well as the universitys first student bill of rights in the weeks to follow 
asmsu will also be increasing student opportunities by appointing new freshmen ambassadors 
and judicial council justices asmsu has taken on more opening weeks activities this year than 
in any past years including legend of the bobcat the gold rush substancefree tailgate and 
subtacular asmsu has added all of these in a fiscally responsible way
my message to students was to expect more from their student leaders and though i have 
remained dedicated to that mission i know that my actions on august 16th failed to uphold this 
commitment i have been honest with our students i have had the humility to accept what i have 
done wrong i have listened to students and i have persevered in this difficult situation i have 
learned a great deal from reflecting on this situation both about myself and the student body
it is with deep regret that i share with all of you that i will be resigning from the office of asmsu 
president effective october 1st their faith into asmsu and to begin focusing on the numerous 
other important issues that are present on this campus i have every confidence that vice 
president levi birky will provide great leadership in assuming the duties of asmsu president
there are still a number of issues that i intend to address this year including revising our academic 
calendar and dead week policy improving parking security for our students increasing classroom 
space improving renters literacy on campus and rejuvenating our bobcat spirit at athletic events 
these are all things that i campaigned on last spring and i have every intention of following 
through on my promises i am of the belief that this is not a time to give up rather it is a time to 

learn and move forward
for those of you who voted me as your president last spring i want you to know that even though 
i will be taking on an informal role outside of asmsu i am still committed to stewardship spirit 
and student engagement at montana state university
respectfully yours

departments hold constitution 
day debate on citizens united
by 
timoth
y a
dams
e departments of political science 
philosophy and religious studies celebrat
ed constitution day last ursday sept 
17 with a debate on citizens united in the 
procrastinator
  an audience of just over 100 gathered 
to watch students alyssa price charlie ber
nstein and lena wooldridge debate profes

sors david parker and sara rushing over 

the claim that the united states supreme 

court ruling in citizens united in 2010 

is a threat to our democracy e supreme 

court ruled that the first amendment 

rights to free speech applied to nonprots 

labor unions and corporations most of the 

discussion centered around the topic of 

corporate expenditures and their inuence 

on elections
price a student in the history depart
ment argued that there is a long history in 

the united states of governments limiting 
corporations participation in elections 
citing teddy roosevelts trust busting poli
cies in 1904  price argued that campaign 
spending can become corrupt when it 

involves corporations and that it ultimately 

undermines our condence in democracy 

price also noted that corporations can bla
tantly lie to the public and that their large 

amounts of money to spend on campaigns 

drown out the voices of individual citizens
philosophy student bernstein said that 
participation of corporations in our elec

toral process perverts our normal electoral 

process since any purchase we now make 

we are voting with our dollars  bernstein 

argued that the involvement of corpora
tions in our democracy creates a dollaro
cracy which has created an unequal system 

of democracy in the united states  bern
stein also quoted john locke to support his 
arguments and said that citizens united 
has resulted in less freedoms for voters
e last student to speak on the panel 
was wooldridge a political science student  
she argued that the allowance of more 
corporate inuence has created a system 
with more anonymous donors and more 

dark money  wooldridge also argued that 

citizens united and increasing amounts 

of campaign spending has resulted in more 

sensationalized campaigns and has bull
dozed the level playing eld that is needed 

in a representative democracy
david parker a professor in the political 
science department was the one panelist 

to argue in favor of citizens united saying 
that he is a political scientist who believes 
in objective studies of moneys inuence in 
politics and that studies have shown large 
amounts of money actually increase educa
tion of issues to the public  parker cited 
gures showing that the so drink industry 
spends far more on advertising to the public 

than it does on political speech and asserted 
that the notion of money buying elections is 
nonsense because of many examples of poli
ticians and groups spending large amounts 

of money to later lose at the ballot box
parker said that politics has always 
been a nasty business giving quotes from 

presidential campaigns far in the past he 

concluded by citing a study showing that 

increased negative political advertising also 

increased voter turnout
e last to speak on the panel was politi
cal science professor sara rushing who 

opened saying she wouldnt use numbers 

in the same way parker had to make her 

point  rushing said that citizens united 
has caused the american people to lose 
faith in democracy and that while the court 
ruling dened corruption in very specic 
terms bribery she believed that the dam
age caused by the corruption met a much 

broader denition rushing said she be
lieved that citizens united created systemic 

corruption of our democracy which she 

contended was much worse than bribery of 

individual politicians or quid pro quo favor 

trading cited by the supreme court  
rushing cited numbers showing that 
the overall spending of smaller contribu
tions paled in comparison to the amounts 

raised by the wealthy rushing stated that 

87 percent of the public make no political 

contributions and cited numbers from the 

romney presidential campaign in 2012 

showing that a small group of 40 donors 
gave a combined amount triple to that 
of romneys 350000 individual small 
amount donors 
aer the panel audience members asked 
questions and challenged parker on some of 
his assertions about peerreviewed studies 
not showing money inuence races  parker 
stood his ground and appeared to even 

convince some of his fellow panelists at 

times when saying although money was a 

prerequisite to getting into a race it was no 

guarantee of winning  parker pointed to 

numbers from his book battle for the big 

sky which took an indepth looks at the 

2012 montana senate race between sena
tor jon tester and congressman denny

weve all been there driving through 
a packed parking lot when you spot an 
empty space tucked away patting yourself 

on the back you pull forward only to dis
cover it is exclusively handicap parking 

it wasnt until this summer that 
i experienced handicap parking 

firsthand as a good thing an 
intriguing mishap in july left 
me with two broken legs and a 
wheelchair the importance of 
handicap parking first dawned 
on me after attempting to roll 
up the interminable slope that is 
the walmart parking lot trans
portation is a major issue without four 
fully functioning limbs
my transportation has since upgraded 
to a scooter but stairs are still outside 
the realm of feasibility thus with the 
return to school i begin my personal 
quest for the holy elevator as it turns 
out the aforementioned elevator is nearly 
impossible to locate on campus historic 
buildings are great but they could do 
with a few upgrades air conditioning 
and functional elevators come to mind
i have yet to find a building without an 
elevator but it was a pretty close call in 
culbertson upon inquiring how i might 
make my way up to the study abroad of
fice i was informed that the cargo eleva
tor would be my only option picture the 

oldfashioned elevators where an elevator 
operator pulls open the gate for the brave 
elevator riders 
now take away the eleva
tor operator and add 

ominous clanking 
and crashing for the 
next three floors
each building 
presents its own 
challenges the sub 
has three elevators 
as well as a floor lift 
but not one of those 
elevators provides 
access to every 

floor as a result one has to crisscross 
the building to access multiple elevators 
in a breathless attempt to make it to the 
bookstore before class while lack of ap
propriate handicap access led to interest
ing adventures such as the discovery of 
the mildly terrifying fourth floor of the 
sub the ideal alternative would be more 
convenient access
the physical dilemmas associated with 
handicapped people are exacerbated by 
the feeling of powerlessness one has to 
trust that the people who designed the 
building took into account the needs 
of all who would require access when 
the layout of campus prevents students 

from arriving to class on time that trust 
has been violated the university has 
an obligation to provide equal 
educational opportunities to all 

the failure to provide for the 
physically disadvantaged is not 
only irresponsible but insulting 
at the very least the university 
should ensure that they are not 
hindering the academic progress 
of students despite receiving 
millions in federal and state 
funds annually msu apparently contin
ues to ignore the accessibility issue as 
the government mandates equal access 
for the physically handicapped it seems 
feasible that at least some of that money 
could go to renovating the buildings to 
provide necessary access points however 
this has yet to be properly addressed as 
this years budget once again fails to pri
oritize the equality of its students 
physical handicaps are some of the 
most difficult circumstances to empathize 
with its hard to appreciate the value of 
walking until it is no longer an option 
the guilty pleasure of riding the elevator 
transforms into the agonizingly slow as
cent to yet another floor that has hallways 
too narrow to turn in the seams in the 
sidewalk become jarring speed bumps 
popping wheelies in a wheelchair is fun 
when one has the option of standing up 
and walking away 
while the build
ings on campus 

could use some 
work before they 
can be deemed 
handicapfriendly 
the students have 
already received 
that commenda
tion countless 

students have held 
the door for me helped carry my books 
and accommodated my injury in an ef
fort to improve the handicap experience 
every time someone asks what happened 
like im a normal human rather than a 
physical abnormality is a victory my 
professors have been patient with my 
lengthy commutes between classes and 
my classmates provide comedic entertain
ment throughout the process it seems 

the only entity in the equation that has 
been derelict in its duties is the univer
sity itself the university has failed on 
a moral and federally mandated level to 

provide for the students thereby turning 
the goodwill of the students into a conso
lation prize for its neglect
i am incredibly fortunate that my 
handicap lasts only for a few months i 

can only imagine the daily struggles of 
those who have lived with their handicap 
for their whole lives the things they 
dont have access to mountain peaks 

hiking trails the fourth floor of gaines 
its time the university makes sure that 

getting an education never falls into that

e residence hall association rha 
is an important and benecial organization 
on campus and it is full of great people 
rha is an organization through which you 
can expand your circle or begin a 

new one rha is something that 
everyone should be familiar with 
because it signicantly impacts 

residential life here on campus 
students not involved in rha 
should realize that a part of their 

tuition goes towards funding this 

organization and take advantage 
to what rha has to oer rha is 
responsible for planning events improving 

buildings getting students opinions heard 
and keeping supplies at each halls front 
desk rha has three levels the executive 

board hall councils and the oor president 
ere are great positions to hold in each 
level and they should all get equal respect 
while the executive board of rha is 
hugely important their actions are not as 

apparent as the other two levels actions e 
executive board is comprised of upperclass
men who discuss current events on campus 

people on this board have an opportunity to 
travel to the iacurh intermountain af
liate of college and university residence 

halls conference e conference this year 
will take place at colorado state university 
and focus on new ways to make housing 
more fun and comfortable while obtaining 
valuable leadership skills is conference 
is one of the few situations where 
schools and their respective hall 
association members can work 
collaboratively to solve problems 

that are inherent in communal liv
ing situations and respond to new 

issues as they arise e executive 

board then creates a better living 

environment here at msu with the 
information they learn
some question the ecacy of sending the 
executive board to the conference since tu
ition dollars are used to fund the trip how
ever the costs of the trip pale in comparison 
to the opportunities for growth that the trip 
provides two heads truly are better than 
one and by putting all of the heads of all of 

the schools that attend iacurh together 
there is the potential to drastically improve 
not only residential life at msu but also to 
improve residential life at other colleges by 
sharing ideas from msu is could have 

farranging impacts on the college and its 
students a better studentliving situation 
could drastically increase our retention rate 

and possibly even the graduation rate a 
solid residential situation is the foundation 
for eective learning so ideas taken from 
other colleges could make msu even better 
as a learning institution
while the executive board and iacurh 
are important the hall councils set up dorm 

events and are the 
people that stu
dents live with hall 
councils will impact 
residential life here 

at montana state 

the most every time 
students go to a dorm 
or housingbased 

event these are the 
people who will have 
planned the event 

prepared for the 
event and are actively 
running the event 

with the goals of having fun and improving

instant gratication marks our gen
eration with the rapid growth of the 
internet and the widespread use of 
smartphones this generation has become 

accustomed to getting what we want 
when we want it rough their 
budgets 39 states have set a clear 

outline for their priorities the in
stant notoriety funneled through 
large sports programs outweighs 
the practical benets of funding 

leadership in higher education 
sports provide a level of instant 
gratication that education typi

cally doesnt at might explain 
why as of the end of scal year 2014 the 

highestpaid public employees in 31 states 
were football coaches another eight 

basketball coaches lead the payrankings in 

their respective states 
 montana is one of the few states which 
for various reasons has taken a dier
ent approach to salarybudgeting e 
highestpaid public employee in the state 
of montana in 2014 was royce engstrom 

the university of montana president ac
cording to the state employee database the 
highestpaid public employee in montana 

for 2015 is the commissioner of higher 
education clay christian 
i am not in any way degrading the accom
plishments of athletic coaches or negating 
the diculty and importance of their jobs 

but what i am saying is that weve made 

economic decisions that make their jobs 
important fans unyielding attendance at 
games does bring in millions of dollars of 
revenue each year however much of that 
is recycled within the athletic department 

through improvement of facilities travel 
and the obvious coaches salaries
if we delve even deeper into the issue 
we see that popular sports teams bring 

notoriety to their schools which brings 
students which brings revenue its not 
the sports are a bad thing its just that 
theyre not necessarily inherently valuable 
medical advancement is valuable whether 

the general population follows its weekly 
progress or not environmental 

research is valuable despite the 

fact that thousands of people 

would never pack themselves into 
uncomfortable stadium seats to 
see it take place e point here 

is that if we take away the fans 
sports become just like any other 
club on campus something with 

the potential to improve the 
quality of life of students as they get their 
educations
ats the key word here  education 
e purpose of universities is to educate 
folks and send them o into the world 
more apt to be productive members of 
society in principle education creates 

society that is less violent and more ac
cepting of diversity within said society in 
recent years msu has set a precedent for 

universities bettering their communities 
much of this can be attributed to presi
dent waded cruzados leadership 
via the oce of the president cru
zados veyear tenure at msu has seen 

hundreds of millions of dollars in com
petitive research funds won and enroll
ment records set cruzado has overseen 

the major renovation of gaines hall and 

the construction of both the animal 
bioscience building and jabs hall along 
with numerous other large construction 
projects around campus cruzado played 
a crucial role in raising funds for all of 

these projects and her eorts have directly 
impacted all students on campus my edu
cation has been bettered by cruzado and 
id like to think the world will be a better 
place for that fact 
bravo montana im proud to partici
pate in higher education in a state where 
university presidents are valued on an 

appropriate scale 

and their salaries 

follow suit while 

going to class for 

years to get an 

education may not

laws
by montana law bikes are 
treated the same as vehicles and 
have to obey the same laws 

 cyclists are to follow traffic 

signals signs and the signals 

of cars as if they are driving 

a car themselves 
 a bike cannot have more 

people on it than seats 
 bikes are to be ridden as far 

to the right on a roadway as 

possible 
 unless riding in a bike lane 

no more than two people 

can ride next to each other 
 within the city no person 

over the age of 15 can ride 

on the sidewalk 
 no bikes are to be ridden on 

sidewalks within the busi
ness district the downtown 
area by main street
 bikes are to yield to pedes
trians and give an audible 

signal when they are going 

to pass a pedestrian on a 

sidewalk
 bikes must have brakes pow
erful enough to skid out on 

pavement 
 at night cyclists must have 

a white light attached to 

the front of the bike that 
projects at least 200 feet in 

addition to a red reflector 

that can be seen from at least 

50 feet behind 
 breaking bicycle laws can 

lead to citations and fines
danger on the road
following these rules does 
not always prevent accidents 

on july 31 bozeman resident 

carol weaver was riding her 

bike across a private parking lot 

on main street when she was 

hit by a oneton pickup the 

incident caused five fractures in 

weavers sacrum and pelvis she 

spent a week in the hospital 

underwent surgery and contin
ues physical therapy
weaver believes that bikers 
can take measures to lessen their 

chances of being involved in an 

accident a lot of people think 

they are pedestrians but they 

need to follow the rules of the 

road like a car if a car can turn 

right and a bike is to the right 

and they need to go straight 

ahead theres a good chance 

a car could turn into them 

weaver said
though there are bike lanes 
across bozeman bikers still 

travel with traffic
they need to pay attention 
to where they are with the cars 

weaver said
staying safe
weaver credits her helmet 
with preventing her accident from 
being any worse she emphasized 

the importance of helmets and 

would like to see more people 

wearing them she also believes 

that wearing proper clothing 

at night can prevent accidents 

there are so many people who 

dont wear helmets just in an 

instant your life can change so 

badly a lot of people dont wear 

bike lights at night so cars cant 

see them weaver said for 

bikers learning how to use hand 

signals is of obvious importance 

but those driving cars also need 

to know how to read these hand 
signals weaver would like to 
see students be careful both 

when walking and biking across 

campus in the winter because 

cars might not be able to stop 

at crosswalks when it is icy 

leaving on time can also help to 

prevent accidents some people 

just start out too late for where 

they need to go and they get a 

little careless weaver said
for students weaver 
believes that proper biking 

education can be beneficial 

and help ensure that those new 

to town can learn bozeman 

bike laws and stay safe those 

driving cars can also become 

acquainted with these laws 

to ensure they dont become 

involved in an accident with a 

bike 
montana state university 
police department msupd 

sergeant matt wemple teaches 

the bike patrol school for msupd 

and emphasizes that bikers have 

to be aware of their surroundings 

and understand that cars may not 

be able to see bikes especially 

at intersections the numbers 

are against you as a cyclist as far 
as the driver of a vehicle seeing 
you wemple said
many students do not know 
that bikes cannot be ridden 

across crosswalks which wemple 

sees frequently crosswalks are 

designed for pedestrians and 

cyclists are to get off their bikes 

and walk across crosswalks 
proper signaling at intersections 
is essential to staying safe and 
wemple notices some bikers 
dont at stop signs or signal prop
erly at intersections cyclists 

either come blazing through 

crosswalks or they come up to 

intersections and dont stop and 

thats where they get hit by cars 

because the cars dont see them 

and theyre usually going way too 

fast for the car to be able to react

information from the bozeman daily chronicle
as a college town a significant number of students bike across bozeman daily biking can offer 
a beneficial alternative to driving but when done carelessly can be dangerous knowing the 
laws and paying extra attention to traffic can help students and residents of the community to 

arrive safely at their destinations
at all wemple said
wemple says that the two 
most important rules to follow 
when biking are that cyclists 

should be treated as the drivers 

of vehicles and that cyclists 

need to be seen predictable 

and paranoid
at night wemple also sees 
many students riding without 
an attached headlight and 
explains that a headlamp does 

not satisfy the requirement of a 
real headlight although there 

is no law requiring helmets 

wemple emphasizes that helmets 

are essential to staying safe 

bike helmets should be certi
fied by a safety organization 

like the us consumer product 

safety commission the foam in 

helmets deteriorates and because 

of regular wear and tear helmets 
should be replaced approximately 
every three years 
on campus bike theft is also 
a problem wemple deals with 

msupd encourages students to 

register their bikes msupd has 

the serial number of registered 

bikes on record for life and there
fore will have a better chance of 

recovering a stolen bike wemple 

emphasizes that locking bikes 

is essential and that for more 

expensive bikes two locks can be 

a strategy for preventing theft 

the majority of stolen bikes are 

not locked or registered with 
msu making them 

difficult to recover 

residence halls have 

the highest number 

of thefts and as 

wemple points out 

if students do not 

use their bikes reg
ularly thieves may 

notice a bike has not 

been moved for an 

extended period of 

time steal the bike 

and the student may 

not immediately 

report the theft 

also making it dif
ficult to recover

womens rugby dominates utah state for second win of the season
by davis co
nnelle
yin front of a modest but appreciative 
home crowd the montana state womens 
rugby club took down utah state by 

a score of 4921 the beautiful sunny 
weather matched the cats play on the 
pitch running up and down and all over 
the usu side on their way to their second 
win of the young season 
the womens rugby club only became 
an official sporting club at msu last 

spring semester 
now able to bear the 
bobcat name the women compete in 

dii collegiate rugby allowing them to 

compete for national championships 
boasting a strong core of nearly 30 play
ers the squad competes in what is known 
as rugby union in the fall season this 
means that there are 15 players to a side 

trying to advance the ball toward the end
line without passing 

the ball forward 

only laterally or 
backwards should 
they touch the ball 
down past the end
line they earn five 
points  called a 
try  with a chance 
to earn an additional 
two on the ensuing 
placekick
e game is really about possession 
msu head coach ed mckenna ex
plained its a little more continuous than 
say football rugby began in the 1800s 

in england but has been steadily gaining 

a foothold in the united states in recent 
decades especially on 

college campuses
on saturday 
the cats made the 

seemingly compli
cated game look easy 
aer a tenuous rst 

few minutes msu 
busted the game 
open and didnt 
look back up by a 
narrow margin at the 
half the cats kicked it up to another gear 
aer the break and if not for a couple late 
utah state tries the nal score wouldve 
looked much uglier ree bobcats scored 

twice each to lead the way for msu dallas 

flager maria michelotti and ivanna lopez
utah state scored a couple late tries 
but for the most part we controlled the 

game which was fantastic mckenna said 
i hope that the student body will rec
ognize that there are a lot of sports clubs 
that do really well  so get out there and 
support your peers eyre committed and 

we hope that this is something that our ad
ministration and students can get behind 
the cats continue their homestand 
this weekend with a match against utah 

valley as the conference season kicks into 

full gear they will kickoff on saturday 
sept 26 at 1 pm on the dobbie lambert 
intramural fields behind roskie dorm
i hope that the student 
body will recognize that 
there are a lot of sports 
clubs that do really well 
 so get out there and 
support your peers

washington eagles 5550 in cheney
 in a display of oensive excellence

newell led 
msu running backs with 95 yards and 

1 touchdown and senior wide receiver 
mitchell herbert led the cats in receiv
ing with 83 yards and 2 touchdowns
while the cats typically made their 
scores on long timeconsuming drives 

the eagles put up points with their 
high explosive oense that relied on 
their core of athletic playmakers and 
missed tackles eagle qb jordan west 
needed only 24 attempts to pass for 
410 yards and 6 touchdowns roughly 

17 yards per attempt rb jabari wil
son led the team in rushing with 188 
yards and 2 touchdowns and big sky 

conference oensive mvp cooper 

kupp had a eld day with 12 recep
tions 201 yards and 3 touchdowns 
e day started poorly for the 
bobcats when on their rst drive the 

cats attempted a run on 4th and 2 

from their own 33yard line e cats 

were stued at the line of scrimmage 

and the eagles took advantage with a 

31yard td from wilson e next 

drive the bobcats again went for it 

on fourth and short this time on the 

eagles 15yard line but were again de
nied and quickly gave up a west td

with sophomore jayshawn gates 28

yard touchdown run but quickly gave 

up two consecutive tds going down 

287 early in the second quarter
from this point the cats and the 
eagles went about trading scores 
with the eagles holding the cats at 
armslength through the 3rd quarter 
at the conclusion of which the score 
was 4831 in favor of the eagles e 
cats started 4th quarter action with a 
twoyard prukop rushing touchdown 
cutting the lead to 10 e eagles

sive end mac bignell forced a malcolm 
williams fumble which was recovered 
by marcus tappan e cats wasted 
no time scoring when mitch herbert 
made arguably the playoftheyear 

with a twisting athletic onehanded 
grab in the endzone bringing the score 
to 5550 aer yet another failed two 

point conversion aer a missed eld 
goal the cats regained possession 

with 33 seconds on their own 20 but

with 12 ere were 

some good individual 

performances from 

a statistical perspec

thing is that dierent people stepped up at

montana state graduates bring a ea to bozeman
by sabri
na ha
yes
coming from the creative 
community we recognized how 
dicult it is to sell handmade 
items at a fair price said jasmine 
snyder founder of bozeman flea 

in the end it was about bringing 

together a group of creatives and 
collectors in an environment that 
was conducive to selling items at 

a slightly higher price point and 

also to encourage connections 
between these folks with hopes 
for future collaborations and 
personal relationships
 snyder a msu graduate in 
metalwork and ceramics and 
kate lindsay a graduate in 
sculpture started bozeman flea 
last spring in an eort to provide 

an environment for creatives and 

collectors to ourish build ties 
and nourish success in the com
munity 
once we made the decision to 
move forward with the bozeman 

flea we did some research into 
other likeminded markets to see 

how they marketed themselves 
to the right clientele and built a 
brand that was recognizable and 

desirable from a clients perspec

tive snyder said using their 

favorite ea markets from around 
the country as stepping stones 
snyder and lindsay debuted 

bozeman flea last february
eir rst market had only 
eight vendors as the summer 

markets progressed bozeman 

flea grew and grew until their 
online list of vendors reached a 
whopping 25
we think its a wonderful 
place to meet people and get 

involved in bozemans creative 

community especially if you 

didnt grow up in the area its 
also a great place to nd oneof
akind vintage clothing pieces 

antiques jewelry accessories and 

housewares snyder said and if 
you love the hunt like we do that 
can be a very satisfying reward
megan mcgagan a bozeman 
flea vendor and another msu 
alum from the college of arts 
and architecture said what i 
love about the bozeman flea is 
the community of vendors and 

peoples of bozeman who come 

together for a fun time and to 
share their quality wares it is fun 
interacting with the public and 
sharing the stories of my brand 

poultry haus and our products
christopher bieniek is another 
flea vendor and msu graduate 

hes been a vendor with bozeman 
flea since the beginning ere 
are so many interesting people 

you get to meet at the market 

he said eir products are an 

extension of their personalities 

making it a visual and intellec

tual feast
roughout the summer boze
man flea held three markets in 

the baxter hotel on main with 

the fourth and last market this 

sunday sept 27 from 11 am 

to 4 pm we denitely want to 

say goodbye to this incredible 
season with a bang snyder said 
e atmosphere is always really 

incredible  our summer part
nership with the baxter has really 
set the tone for bozeman flea as 
we nd our footing in the com
munity and the baxter provided 

a bloody mary and mimosa bar 

which on a sunday morning is 

pretty rad
besides the bar this sundays mar
ket will feature live music from drink 

me pretty summer markdowns and 

new fall wares according to snyder
next month bozeman flea is 
hosting a special market in the 

spirit of halloween e market 
will include a maskbuilding cra 
table and other family friendly 

elements snyder said be
ing halloween enthusiasts we 

thought it would be nice to oer 

people an opportunity to get a 

jump start on the festivities with 

a market early in the month we 
want folks to have time to build 
a costume around whatever gems 

they unearth at the flea and we 

have asked our vintage clothing 

vendors to assemble a collection of 

costume worthy items to inspire 
customers to get in the spirit
hosted in the emerson cul
tural center on oct 10 more 
information will be available in 
the next week as bozeman flea 
nalizes all the details and vendors

horror is dead new game 
until dawn proves it
by adam waldorf
have you ever wondered what it would be 
like to be stuck in the woods with seven of 
your closest friends who are all jerks to each 
other have you wondered what it would be 

like to be chased through said forest by an 

unknown being if you said yes to either of 

these questions until dawn probably has 

the answers 
if you have spent any amount of time 
looking at video games on the internet you 

have probably heard of until dawn for 

those who havent its the newest horror 

game you can get on the playstation 4 

essentially it is a playable horror movie 

where you determine what each character 

does in each situation and what you choose 

determines the fate of each character 
you can make it through the game with everyone 

surviving everyone dying or a mixture of 
the two e fact that each character is out 
of the game once you accidentally kill them 

makes the entire atmosphere of the game 

that much more stressful  
e plot of the game while entertaining 
doesnt bring anything new to the horror 

genre e game starts o with all of the 

characters in a cabin in the woods seven 

of the characters decide to pull a prank on 

another person hannah whose brother 

is passed out and cant partake e prank 

gets taken too far and hannah runs into 

the woods beth her sister follows hannah 

to comfort her because running into the 
woods seemed like a proper solution to the 
problem ey get cornered by a masked 
man and fall o of a cli to their demise  
and none of their friends know what hap
pened to them a year later the two sisters 

brother josh invites the remaining friends 

samantha mike jessica ashley emily 

matt and chris to the cabin to mourn the 

loss of his sisters from there things get real 

a psycho starts to attack them and crazy 

carnivorous monsters start to chase them 

down 
you get to determine what happens 
e place the game really shines is the 
graphics and voice acting until dawn 
looks beautiful  e textures are crisp and 
the character models look all too real e 
detail makes the game more relatable and 
makes you care about the characters more 
than you otherwise would e game is also 
littered with amazing voice actors fronted 

by hayden panetierre who push an already 

great script over the top
although the game looks and sounds 
great it does have its aws e controls 
are comprised entirely of the ps4s motion 
controls and quick time events when you 

have to choose an option or look at an item 

you rotate the controller the way the screen 

prompts you while its a good idea it can 

be wonky and cause frustration in the more 
stressful parts of the game 
when playing a horror game there is one 
important question that makes or breaks 
the game is it scary e answer for that is 

yes and no e game is lled le and right 
with jump scares but aer your heart slows 

down they quickly leave ere were mul
tiple times when playing it where i practi

cally jumped out of my seat which is always 

a good thing but none of the scares really 

stick with you  it also uses the gross factor 

a bit too much for my taste it scares you 

physically but never really mentally which 
is why i thought the game was ineective  
allinall until dawn is a beautiful 
game with an amazing story that simply 
falls at in two major areas if it werent en
tirely based on motion control and quick
time events it would be a lot better also 

the game needed to do a bit more than 
make me jump and gross me out to actually 
be scary so if you want to jump a bunch 

of times and honestly laugh a couple of 

times i would highly recommend until 

dawn developer supermassive games 

created a beautiful game that unfortunately 
wont stick with you more than two days 
aer playing it 
you can pick it up at any 
game store or on the ps4 marketplace for 

around 60 but i would recommend wait
ing until it drops down to 20 or 30

a teacher in montana state universitys 
native american studies department as 
well as a grad student working toward 

her phd discussed how the transgender 
community can use its newfound exposure 
to talk about transgender rights lives and 
conversations 
in a discussion of celebrities specically 
those identifying as transgender and the 

use of their media exposure medicine 

horse expressed mixed feelings she appre
ciates the exposure transgender celebrities

brought to the community cox is a trans

gender activist and an actress on orange 

is the 
new black and jennings an adoles
cent 
youtube celebrity is the writer of the 
childrens book i am jazz about gender 
transitioning medicine horse commented 
that this attention toward transgender 
people shows that they are a viable vi

brant part of the social condition
celebrities however can oen be the 
exceptions to the rule e picture the 

public sees is usually the nished product 

of transition and can oen ignore the 

dark side to being transgender ey had 
good connections at the right time and 
didnt have to deal with the same problems 

as others who decide to transition such as 

access to money and social support
many transgender people are never seen 
because they have a lot to lose by going 

through a transition and thereby make 
transgender people into even more of a 
minority is means there are less people 

around to battle the stereotypes and me
dias choice of sensation stories are there 
cuckoo birds within the trans community 
you bet there are 
no more than in any 
other group medicine horse stated but 

the transgender community is smaller so 
its more noticeable
when asked for a comment on trans
gender celebrities medicine horse said 

she would ask them where were you 
when we were in the trenches to explain 

this she discussed the job refusals loss 

of family homelessness and violence that 

many who are transitioning deal with 

much of this loss is based in the concept 

discussed in part one of this article  

many people are comfortable with the 

boxes that they have created for others 

anyone who no longer ts into that box is 

considered disposable
medicine horse desires for those with 
the pulpit to use it wisely ey could start 

foundations or fund homeless shelters 
medicine horse said they need to take a 
stand and get active change what you 
can make it a better place for somebody

asmsu vice president nomination announced
by lilly brogger
following the announcement of asmsu 
president gwynn simeniuks resignation 
current asmsu vice president levi birky 

will ll the oce of president as of oct 1 

e asmsu constitution dictates that 

the new president nominates a candidate 

to ll the oce of vice president birky has 

nominated holly capp and if capp receives 

a majority vote from the asmsu senate on 

oct 1 she will begin 

her duties as vice

president
 birky chose capp 
based on her experi

ence with asmsu as 

an advocat coordina
tor and with university 

administration upon 

receiving birkys nomi

nation capp submit
ted her application as 

well as recommenda
tions from various 

msu faculty to 

asmsu colleagues
capp began her involvement with 
asmsu last december as the elec

tions directorassociate a position she 

currrently holds she held the asmsu 

senate secretary position and served on the 

asmsu legislative committee also the 

advocat coordinator for the msu oce 

of admissions capp hopes to bring the 

experience from the diverse set of students 

she works with in that position to asmsu 

capp was also a student regent nalist last 

spring which involved learning about stu
dent government and allowed her to served 

as a student representative on the montana 

board of public education
capp has worked with birky in the past 
and believes this will help them to accom
plish their future goals i think that levi 

and i can work very closely together capp 

said we have before he was actually my 

liaison last year in elections and i did a lot of 

work with him on the legislative committee 

as well so we know how each other works 
and i think it de

nitely compliments 

each other 
birky and capp 
are now focused on 

nding out what 

students expect from 

a student leader and 

what they would like 

to see from student 

government i think 

were actually probably 

going to do something 

a little revolutionary 

for a politician and just 

listen for these next 
couple weeks and then aer that listening 

well set some priorities and goals birky said 

i think what we really need to focus on in 

this transition especially is gaining some trust 

back with the students and i think thats best 

done through listening
birky believes that expecting students to 
come to their student government is no lon
ger a viable method of learning what students 

want so he plans to go out to student groups 

its time for us to actually get out there and 

see what they have to say birky said
birky and capp have held office hours 
throughout this week for students to 

voice their questions and concerns about 

the transition pending asmsu senates 

approval of capp filling the position 

of vice president her office hours will 

be posted on asmsus website birky 
and capp both expressed that while the 

situation is not ideal they are looking 

forward to continuing the success of

training day

everyone has seen the this is a tobacco free 
campus signs littered across the doors and 
buildings of msu yet at times it feels like 
there are students smoking on every corner in 
some senses there are while msu 
has a tobacco free campus policy 

there are certain public property 
areas that have been cordoned o 
for smoking since most students 
are over 18 it is legal for them to 

purchase tobacco products and they 
have the right to smoke in public 
areas that allow it secondhand 
smoke is typically enough to keep 

nonsmokers from gathering in those areas but 
in coming years that may not be true with 

the introduction of electronic cigarettes or 
ecigarettes in 2007 the social stigma against 
smoking has lessened ese are marketed to 
help smokers quit and come in a variety of 
avors deliciously packaged to look like the 
next big candy item because they produce only 

vapor the only smell is that of the avoring 
e cartridges come in a variety of nicotine 
concentrations to help wean smokers o the 
addictive substance despite these advertised 
benets the introduction of ecigarettes has 
created tremendous backlash
one of the reasons ecigarettes are so hotly 
debated is their newness because of that they 
can be marketed as a quitaid without any actual 
verication and lack licensure by the fda ey 
are not regulated by the federal government 
which means technically there is no age restric
tion on buying one while most stores will not 
sell to someone under 18 a sixyear old could 
reasonably demand to purchase an ecigarette 
e lack of federal control extends to the car
tridges anyone and their dog could make these 

and sell them commercially to the general public 
ere is no quality assurance check meaning the 
buyer has no idea what is going into the product 
and eventually into their body
is represents a considerable health hazard 
one that should worry ecigarette users if 
the chemicals in the cartridge react poorly 
with alcohol already in someones system the 
repercussions are unpredictable and potentially 
dangerous while cigarettes contain over 60 
carcinogens ecigarettes deliver nicotine in a 
liquid form exposure to liquid nicotine can 
result in a visit to the local poison center all 
across the nation poison centers have noticed 
a marked increase in calls about ecigarette 
exposure some resulting in er visits students 
analyze the food that goes into their bod
ies counting calories and doublechecking 

ingredient lists and one should do the same 
with highly concentrated potentially lethal 

chemicals 
because ecigarettes are so new the long
term health eects have yet to be determined 
over 2000 studies were published on e
cigarettes in the past year in a desperate attempt 
to play catchup but it takes time to 

process and validate those results 

for now the police department as 
well as the university err on the side 
of caution ecigarettes fall under the 
category of smokeproducing prod
ucts and are therefore a violation of 
campus policy it is possible that this 
could be changed if research validates 
claims that ecigarettes are benecial 
but that could be over ten years in the future 
because of the newness of the product they 

lack any denitive proof positively or negatively 
promoting them for now students on campus 
must respect current policy not only because 
it is required but also because it is the safest 
option
one must ask why ecigarettes are so popular 
since they arent legally considered a quitaide 

cigarettes are dramatically cheaper than e
cigarettes and college students are notoriously 
short on cash what would induce them to 
pay more money e answer is that vaporizers 
can be used to smoke marijuana is makes 
smoking marijuana or vaping easy conve
nient and far less noticeable it is also in direct 

violation of state and federal drug laws as well 
as campus policy last year was the rst time 
that marijuana use reports surpassed tobacco 
use on campus e introduction of ecigarettes 
into the equation presents challenges to local 
law enforcement and the safety of the students 
when one uses tobacco in conjunction with 
alcohol the eects are far less drastic than be
ing twisted or drunk and high on marijuana 

simultaneously when students become a 
threat to personal safety or the safety of others 
it is critical to involve the police ere is a 
dierence between giggling ridiculously while 
high and physically lashing out in a way that 
causes injury ecigarettes make the dangerous 
aspects of being crossed more likely because 
they allow convenient access to marijuana it 
is far less conspicuous to exhale a little vapor 
that quickly dissipates than to pull out a bong 
and smoke on a street corner access is a critical 
component of frequently abused substances 
ecigarettes put illegal activity further into the 
realm of feasibility e university has combat
ted this new threat with 42 tobacco conduct 

violations as well as 88 residence hall tobacco 
violations since july 2014
e introduction of the ecigarette into 
college society has had a destructive impact 
e university has taken a rm stance against 

it but university ocials only see so much 
e primary problem comes from students 
who in willful ignorance put their bodies and 

minds at risk understanding the reality of e
cigarettes as well as the consequences incurred 
should be a thought before blindly using the 

latest toy students are paying thousands of 
dollars in tuition to access resources to grow 
their intellect yet run towards dangerous new 
trends with reckless abandon a moments 

pause should be taken to consider why one 

would use this particular product when it is a 
agrant violation of university policy and such 
a detriment to ones health are ecigarettes 

really fullling all the promises made or are 
they yet another hazardous attempt to nd the 
perfect high

practicing proper petiquette prioritize your puppies
pets are oen regarded as members 
of the family however recent 

trends in tethering pets on campus 
have demonstrated that they are not oen 

treated as such while leaving a child tied 

to a bike rack outside a public building 

for hours at a time is unheard of 

and would spark erce outrage 

from bystanders leaving a dog in 

a similar position is not both are 

unlawful actions in bozeman 
many students are dog owners 
and feel compelled to bring their 

fourlegged companions to cam
pus which is great e university 

can oen be a stressful environ
ment and pets can be a stress

reducing resource as long as dog owners 

are operating within legal boundaries msu 

welcomes student pets as pet policies and 

laws vary from university to university it 

can be dicult to determine what is and is 

not allowed on our campus 
ere are several regulations associated 
with owning an animal within bozeman 

city limits likewise there are many rules 

regarding pets on campus msu policy 

is concordant with the ordinances of 
bozeman campus policy states that no 

dogs other than service dogs are permit
ted within any facility so owners bringing 

nonservice dogs to campus are le with 

few options in caring for their animals 
a just action would be leaving the pet at 
home fulltime students whose 

schedules do not allow leaving a 

dog at home may nd that own
ing a dog is not the right option 

for their situations a frequent al
ternative to doing the right thing 

and leaving nonservice dogs at 

home or in proper care is tether
ing them outside of buildings 

ough a bozeman city ordinance 

restricts owners from leaving dogs 
unattended in a public location dog own
ers continue to disregard the law
there are several risks associated with 
illegally leaving a dog tethered outside a 

classroom and not one is worth bringing 

a dog to school when an owner teth
ers their dog outside while they attend 

class they are leaving their pet subject to 

any number of hazards including poor 

weather theft and physical abuse a dog 

may also become anxious during their 
temporary abandonment and react ag
gressively toward the crowds of strangers 

by which it is surrounded while it is un
derstandable that an anxious and fright
ened dog may bite 

a stranger the dog 

would be deemed 

a vicious animal by 

the city of boze
man and be subject 

to impoundment or 

even destruction at 

the owners expense 

this is a steep price 
to pay to go to lectures accompanied by 

a dog 
besides the legal concerns there are 
moral issues to consider when tying up 

dogs dog tethering can be an act of 
cruelty most dogs tied up on campus are 

waiting for their owners to return after  

one two or even threehour long courses 

these dogs are often left without food or 
water in addition 

to a lack of lifesus

taining necessities a 

lack of supervision 

leaves a tethered 

dog susceptible to 

entanglement dogs 

that are frequently 

tied up for hours at 

a time are also prone 
to psychological damage 
tethering is 
more harmful to a dog than it could ever 

be beneficial not only is leaving a dog 

tied up alone outside a public building 

illegal it is just plain wrong

75004greek life overrepresented in campus leadership
school leadership is a messy topic 
to discuss whether people are pay
ing attention or not only under 
exceptional circumstances like the recent 

controversies do students begin to ques

tion who is leading their school on any 

given day there are 21 asmsu 

senators dozens of ras and 

countless orientation and club 

leaders that are all groups of 

students representing students 
consider the fact that only 
about five percent of msu 

students are involved in sorori

ties or fraternities commonly 

referred to as greek life but al
most 25 percent of asmsu senators and 

50 percent of the orientation leaders on 

campus are greek nongreek students 

at msu arent fairly represented and to 

incoming freshman and outside observers 

msu may look like a significantly more 
greekcentric school than it is 
this isnt 
an accurate representation of the student 
body despite the fact that these leaders are 

charged to represent said student body
this is not in any way trying to dis
credit greek life in fact people involved 
in greek life are on paper more involved 

in the school than the average student 

after all involvement is a huge part of 

greek life with many opportunities for 

community service and events as well as a 

strong push to get students participating 
on campus
e problem is that greek life 
by nature creates a sort of micro
cosm between all the dierent 

fraternities and sororities which 
have a culture of their own that is 
unique from all the other cultures 

on campus its a culture that 

numerically is unfairly overrep
resented compared to any other 
single groupable set of people on campus 
part of the problem when groups 
become this domineering is that those 

representative positions they are filling 

also become part of their microcosm 

creating a chasm between leadership and 
the people they are supposed to repre
sent its not possible to fairly represent 
something that one is not a part of it and 

not all groups are going to get fairly repre
sented with such an overabundance of the 

greeks in leadership positions
when every other orientation leader 
says they are involved in greek life that 

gives incoming freshmen the impression 

that a significant number of students are 

involved in greek life 
what msu needs is not necessarily less 
greeks in leadership 

but simply a more 

diverse population of 

students running for 

such positions year 
after year highly 
qualified students 

run for senate seats 

and dont get elected 

because they dont 

have backing of a 

large group of people at their disposal 

when only a small percent of students 

are voting in campus elections having 

any single greek chapter push for one of 

their members to win will greatly sway the 
vote let alone if multiple houses do this 
last year 1814 ballots were cast which 

equalled a measly 127 percent of the 

student body 
much like national elections a big 
problem with the results is that not 
enough people care to vote 
the people 
that are pressured to vote are going to 

be those already involved in the system 

in some way when greek life becomes 

a part of that system they get the greek 

vote 
this creates a massive disadvantage 
for somebody who 

would have to cam
paign for votes as 

opposed to getting 

them simply because 

of their participa
tion in a large club 

system 
if statistics about 
msu show any
thing it is that we 
are a group of people with diverse and 

varying interests and talents all of those 

people should feel like they are an equal 

part of the school leadership positions 

on campus are and should be open to all 

students on campus but to an outsider 

these positions may seem unattainable 

without the support of the greek system 

these positions would be much more di
versely held if simply more people would 

just go out vote and get involved
what msu needs is not 
necessarily less 
greeks in 
leadership but simply a 
more diverse population 
of students running for 
such positions

still reeling from last weeks tough loss 
to eastern washington montana state 
head coach rob ash described saturdays 
matchup against cal poly as a mustwin 
game opening up the big sky conference 
season against a team they had not beaten 

in their last eight attempts the cats needed 
to hit the ground running if they wanted to 
stand a chance compared to their anemic 

starts the last two games ashs squad looked 
more than up to the challenge straight out 

of the gate
at was the ideal gameplan ash said 
aer the game exactly what we tried to do 
 we knew the stakes were high and that we 
needed to get a touchdown on that rst drive
firing o to a 140 lead just 10 minutes 
into the rst quarter the bobcats were 

nally able to give their stilldeveloping 
defense a comfortable lead to protect aer 
an atrocious outing last week the defense 
looked stellar this weekend in slowing 
down cal polys tricky tripleoption oense 
holding the mustangs to just 406 total yards 
while the cats gained 602
on their third possession of the game 
msu busted a massive 88yard playaction 
wide open pass from junior dakota prukop 
to sophomore jayshawn gates to put the 
cats up by three touchdowns just one quar
ter into the game 
a lot of teams are going to try to roll 
down that backside safety to take away the 
zoneread and so when we see those triggers 
from the safety it opens up the deep ball 
noted prukop and coach cramsey did an 
awesome job with our game plan and made 
it easy for us
to their credit cal poly refused to give 
up sticking to their guns and crawling 
back to a 3121 halime decit and with 
the mustangs receiving the ball to start the 
second half the stadium seemed worried 

about another comeback attempt as cal 
poly gained a bit of momentum
ose fears quickly dissipated as the 
bobcat defense forced the mustangs into 

two consecutive threeandouts to open 
the second half while the oense took full 
advantage and the cats bolted out to a 
4521 lead that proved insurmountable 

cal poly closed the gap to 4528 but could 
get no closer than that and the cats proved 
victorious
prukop had himself quite the day throw
ing for 399 yards and three 
tds on 19 of 26 
passing and didnt have to scramble nearly 
as much as he did the previous two weeks 
junior chad newell and the oensive line 

punched in three rushing scores and newell 
gained 111 yards on 19 carries university 
of miami transfer beau sandland nally 

showed the skills he brings to the msu 
oense breaking out for 156 receiving yards 
and two touchdowns in his third game as a 

bobcat aer the game the senior com
mented weve got so many weapons in 

this oense you cant really expect one guy 
to be able to cover oneonone so if theyre 
going to draw attention to one guy then 

another guy will be open and i was just in 
the right spot to make those plays
e cats will look to keep things rolling 
as the head down to northern arizona next 
week for another tough conference match
up e lumberjacks are coming o a 2314 

road loss to the university of montana griz

zlies but are notoriously tough to beat at 
home in the skydome e cats will have to 
continue their winning ways if the want to 
keep pace with the big sky heavyweights in 
the race for a conference championship e 

game will kick o at 405 pm and will be 
televised on abcfox aliates locally

bobcat volleyball takes down grizzlies
by 
ian breuner
e montana state bobcats took down 
the university of montana grizzlies in 
shroyer gym on saturday sept 26 e 
cats defeated the griz 31 and took a 10 
lead in the annual brawl of the wild series 
e griz came out in the rst set with 
authority outhitting the bobcats 476 to 

033 the griz defeated the bobcats to take 
set one with a score of 2512 we started a 
bit tight which is understandable as it was 
a big weekend with homecoming and the 
brawl of the wild coach riley said
msu rebounded in the second set and 
evened the score leading 1711 at one 

point the bobcats went on to win the 
second set 2520 momentum from that win 
carried over into the third set as the bobcats 

came out on top with a score of 2521 one 
thing we have been stressing is to play with 
a calm and clear mind which i think the 
team demonstrated as the match went on 
as well riley said on top of that every 
athlete started to make plays which helped 

contribute to the victory and the bench was 
awesome providing some needed re 
e grizzlies showed some of their earlier 
spark in the fourth set and led early with a 

score of 1410 e bobcats fought back and 
tied the score twice before taking a 2118 
lead e grizzlies rallied back to within one 
at a score of 2322 but the bobcats answered 

with backtoback kills to secure a 2522 vic
tory in the fourth set i know the team really 
wanted that win riley said another major 
factor was the amazing students band and 
community support that showed up which 

really helped fuel the comeback its easy to 
keep ghting in that environment
e bobcats will play the university of 
northern colorado in greeley colo on 
ursday oct 1 leading up to unc we 

are focusing on cleaning up some blocking 
team defense and serving riley said we 
will also keep developing our hitters toolbox 
to help our hitters deal with all scenarios 
which will help our oensive production

sophomore season she had won four of her 

seven races she accumulated 48 nishes in

choices for college she wanted to continue 

to train in the mountains participate in an 

exercise science program and to stay close 

to home snyder found a place at msu 

and hopes to use an exercise science major 

with an english minor to write about 

you guessed it running she has already 

this with her blog e middle distance 

runner at 
alysinrunderlandblogspotcom
 in her blog you can nd tips on running 

update on current training programs and 

reviews of her races
as with most runners she has plenty 
of superstitions from eating three hours 

before every meet the same warm up and 

having the same avor and brand gel before 

each run during high school she wore the 

same socks for every meet even wearing 

them the last race with a hole in them 

e night before each race you will nd 

her watching a movie most frequently the 
tting cool run
nings
when not totally 
engrossed in run
ning one might hear 

snyder talking about 

food while unable 

to narrow down her 

favorite food to one 
single item she will be quick to tell you 

her favorite snack is kit kats dipped in 

nutella she also enjoys bingewatching 

netix whenever she gets the chance
with her opening meet in the books she 
hopes to improve on her third place nish 

proving she belongs at the collegiate level 

certainly hasnt been without adjustment 

her hip exors have been causing some is

in front of the other  she writes in her blog 

that she was diagnosed with a weak booty 

and lazy hip exors ese issues have her 

in the training room three times a week 

rehabbing and gaining strength
a couple months into a blossoming 
collegiate racing career snyder looks to 

ignore the distractions and keep nding 

challenges that make her better whether 

its a paper that teaches her the science of 

running techniques new approaches to 

training or maybe a new nutella creation 

she uses it all as inspiration to fuel her re

moderately broke students who live on 
campus rejoice ere is a new restaurant 
in town that is aordable and in walking 
distance from anywhere on campus its 
called e u and it is located just o of col
lege street next to pickle barrel coming 

to bozeman in late april e u just missed 
the rush of college students making them 

unknown to most people which was appar
ent by the fact that my group of friends and 

i were the only ones there  
when i walked into e u i wasnt 
blown away while it was nicely decorated 

with pictures of local activities on the wall 

nothing was particularly eyecatching 
e walls were very blue which ended up 
distracting me from the other decorations 
e only thing to draw my attention away 
from the painted walls was the menu e 

menu at e u is artistically written on a 
chalkboard with small graphics describing 
most of the menu items is added to the 
atmosphere for me as it looked completely 
original unlike the other decorations  
as i walked up to the counter the person 
at the counter was more than friendly i 
wasnt quite sure what to get and she was 
extremely helpful walking me through 

the menu while eating she approached 
us multiple times to see if everything was 
satisfactory and to see if there was anything 
else we needed e cook even came out to 
ask us how everything was ive never had 
this happen before which made it really 
seem like they wanted their customers to be 

satised it was awesome  
at being said great customer service 
wont bring me back to a restaurant if the 
food isnt good  fortunately for e u 

the food is great  although their menu is 
limited only being able to order burgers 

and milkshakes i was satised by the quality 
of the food ere are a couple of items on 
their menu that seemed unusual to me like a 
burger with salad dressing but most of their 
items were normal  i had a bacon burger 

with a strawberry milkshake while they did 
put a bit too many onions on the burger for  
my liking it was cooked to perfection e 
milkshake was a bit worse lacking avor it 
seemed like they didnt use enough avoring 
in it making it seem bland  
e best part about e u is the price of the 
food e burgers range from 5  7 and the 
milkshakes were 3 i loved this because like 
most of you i am a poor college student e 
food is much better than the price suggests 

making it a prime spot for any college student 

ey are also very quick making it easy to 

swing by and pick up a burger if you have a 

break in your schedule
e u is a casual place to grab a bite be
tween classes or to bring a group of friends 
to its aordable for almost any college 
student and the food and location is great 

ey are open mondays through fridays 
from 11 am  8 pm and saturdays from 
noon  6 pm at 815 w college st you can

the feeling youre in a dierent universe if 

you like jazz that might be the rst thing 
you notice  the airwaves broadcasting 
jazz legends like coltrane mingus and 

miles but look around and youll see 

plenty of other topics leatherbound

with racks of blues cds vinyl records are 

propped quietly beneath the stairs poetry 

books stand across from e adventures

vargos has been in bozeman for over 
30 years  rst where bagelworks now 

stands then another downtown store for 

a time and nally coming to rest at the 

west main front it now occupies dr ben 
leubner an employee and an msu english 
professor calls it as ercely independent as 

jazz itself 
ere are ve employees including the 
owner each with their own specialty ey 
are united by a love of art of music and of 
the soul of the store they work in it has a 

living presence leubner said its a retail 

job created in heaven 
partly he attributes that presence to the 
dogs that make their home in vargos first 

there was jazz who still looks down from 

the walls in photographs  a slim brown

torch has been taken up by abigail who 
amiably wanders the store occasionally

has acquired a semilegendary status in 
the bozeman community it is known as 
an icon a place where people with unique 

interests and ideas can nd an outlet that 
shares their love for jazz for poetry for art 
or for books leubner describes it as a para
dox  a rare and unique environment but 

somewhere many people feel immediately 

at home one of the cool things about it 

is its so out of place he says he describes 

people from all over the country coming to 
bozeman and wishing that they had a book
store as unique as vargos in a way thats 
what makes it so inplace in bozeman
vargos has embraced the spirit of artistry 
in its own atmosphere leubner was very 
excited about the stores new record player 
he discussed the benets of vinyl over 
cds or digital music  the ritual of the 

needle and the record the occasional static 
and scratching the need to be attentive 
in a way that attention to detail represents 
vargos well ey still supply cds and 
vinyl even though digital music has largely 
taken over the industry e posters hanging 
in the store are longdead jazz musicians 
and movie stars e neatly stacked shelves 
are full of obscure books some in foreign 
languages but that leubner says is what 
makes vargos so great its about the music 
the art the poetry way before its ever about 
the money
in the ending of e great poet returns 
the poet mark strand asks a question 
tell 
me you people out there what is poetry 
anyway maybe some peoples poetry is a 

place where golden sax lines dri over pages 

of verse and the soul of a dog named jazz 

still keeps watch over the patrons

ciao buongiorno vorrei un 
ca per favore i learned a mul
titude of italian words and phrases 
during my four month stay in italy 

this past spring but these phrases 

were some of the very rst ey 

translate to hello good morn
ing i would like a coee please 

i learned them so quickly because 
like many students coee is a daily 
staple in my life  as essential as a 
good meal or a good nights sleep 

in fact coee was one of the things 

i anticipated most in my move to 

italy coee is deeply embedded in 

the culture of italy and i could not 

wait to immerse myself in its his

tory and practice so every morn
ing aer my bus ride into the city 

of siena and before my rst class 

i would wander into a dierent 

coee shop and practice those two 

phrases awaiting that bracing rst 
cup of espresso for the day
as with any social interaction in 
a foreign place there was a bit of a 
learning curve e most promi

nent dierences became apparent 

immediately despite its italian 

origins the word espresso is not 

used in italy  one surere way to 

out yourself as a foreigner is to ask 

for an one in fact i learned this les
son the hard way when one barista 
decided it would be funny to pre
tend he had never heard the word 

espresso and even had me write 

the word on a napkin looking at it 

confused until he nally snapped 

his ngers and said oh you want 

a ca so from that point on i 

forever ordered a ca confused 

and slightly hurt by what i came to 

realize was the italian sense of hu
mor other rules were more subtle 

for example you shouldnt order 

a latte or cappuccino aer noon 
why because only children drink 
milk aer noon of course ese 
barriers were frustrating at rst but 
it forced me to take in another per
spective on coee  its context
for as long as i have enjoyed 
coee i have considered it an in
dependent entity the way it tastes 
or is prepared maybe its good 

maybe not but this new experience 

made me aware of where the coee 

is served in what way and why i 

began to see the coee shop as in
timately tied to its product its cus

tomers and its social implications 

is is what happens when you 

uproot yourself from a comfortable 

environment and place yourself in 

an entirely new situation even the 

simplest of tasks take on a complex
ity that never would have been 

necessary in the past i took on this 

newly immense task by picking a 

single coee shop and immersing 

myself completely in it
picking the shop was easy i went 
to school in siena a medieval city 

laid out in a spider web of curv
ing tight cobblestone streets with 
homes and shops crammed into 

aging buildings its safe to say that 

real estate in the center of siena is a 

precious commodity so my school 

actually shared a space with several 

other businesses including a tiny 

coee shop called bar pinatorre
chio i guess i should explain that 

almost all coee shops and bars in 

italy are one and the same serving 

coee by day and alcohol by night 

or sometimes the day too and all 

of them are simply called barre or 

bar in the singular is particu
lar bar was a small establishment 

run by a brother and sister aer i 

picked the pinatorrechio i began 

delving into its world
every morning i would have a 
ca or cappuccino in the bar try
ing to get to know the proprietors 

at rst we were just strangers cus
tomer and server and the language 

barrier did just as its name sug
gests heavily slowing any progress 

i made but day by day coee by 

coee as my italian grew so did my 

relationship with the owners e 

womans name is betti the mans 

marco ey both were born and 

grew up in siena ey inherited 

the bar from their father with each 

new piece of information i could 

feel a relationship growing 
by the end of the semester i 
could hold a conversation with 

both of them and did most days 

i treasured their friendships per
haps more than any others i made 

with italians in siena because 

they unlike my teachers or host 

family had no earthly reason to 

be friendly towards me i liked 

them and they liked me because 
of who we were no more and no 
less
when i arrived in italy i was 
looking forward to the coee 

and i enjoyed it immensely but 

what coee gave me was so much 

more  an environment to bridge 

the cultural divide and make real 
friends nothing could have been 
clearer when i said a nal goodbye 

to marco and betti before leaving 

siena so i implore you the coee 
drinkers to be aware of the context 
of your coee i was lucky enough 
to be forced to take on a new 
perspective but theres nothing 
stopping you from doing it your
self look up from your cup strike 
up a conversation get to know 
someone coee shops are unique 

social hubs and should be treated 

that way coee tastes great but it 

can give us a lot more
what italian cafes taught me about coffee
coffee tastes great but it can give us a lot more

mathematician musician 
two words that dont always go 
together 
two words that dont 
always keep company with the 
cool kid success but who wants 

to be cool these days  success 
should be one step behind yourself 
and two steps behind the dreams 

youre following it certainly isnt 
the main priority for local musi
cian and msu grad student jon 

cheryl whos pursuing a degree in 
one world and a passion in another
jon cheryls life is a bit compli
cated hes currently pursuing a 

masters in statistics which he will 
complete in december his bach
elors degree which he received 

from clemson university in south 
carolina is in math when asked 
how he ended up focusing his edu
cation on mathematics he simply 

laughed and said i guess im just 
a nerdy white boy at heart armed 
with only these details one might 

struggle to imagine the other side 
of his life  the half dominated 
by music but thats the topic that 

lights up his world
if i could have exactly what 
i wanted no consequences id 

just play guitar and sing and write 
songs all day for nobody or every
body cheryl said hes certainly 
put in the work he picked up 
guitar as a kid aer admiring his 
dads but willingly admits for 
every dude that plays guitar no 

matter what he says he probably 
started to impress a girl and i fall 
into that category too 
he also started performing 
young playing bass guitar at 
his church  now aer years of 
practice he plays just about any 

incarnation of guitar electric 
acoustic resonator etc in ad
dition to singing and songwrit
ing however as cheryl moved 

through his life he treated music 
as more of a diversion than a 

priority and its only recently 
that hes begun to question that 
decision
for a long time i thought that 
school math and statistics were 
the wife and that music was the 
mistress  but part of me feels 

like ive had it wrong all this time 

cheryl said musics always been 
there for me never asked for more 
than i wanted to give  and 

maybe school and math was what 
i was fooling around with all this 
time and it was taking my eyes 

away from what i should have 
been looking at
but maybe im all wrong and 
im just wasting my time with 

everything he added laughing 
eectively echoing a sentiment felt 

by many a college student
ough wasting time seems 
to be an exaggeration especially 

when it becomes obvious how 

much he loves what he does 
cheryl entered the bozeman mu
sic scene at the haurau years ago 
and has been performing  both 

solo and with other groups  ever 
since  aer he graduates hell 
potentially pursue music full time 

playing cover gigs and the like 
performing pays well enough to 
help him make poverty level as 

he put it however he recognizes 
that such a lifestyle is precarious
im not 100 percent sure thatll 
work out cheryl said so i feel 

like its necessary to apply to some 
grownup jobs too  something 

newnerd
if he had to pick a practical 
job hed head into data science 

a eld hes quick to point out is 

more creative than one might 

imagine but until a decision one 
way or the other is unavoidable 
hes going to keep a foot in both 

worlds when asked if music 
and math gel in any sort of way 
cheryl hesitated before saying 

ey do  in a very esoteric 
manner
jon cheryl will be performing 
at 
teds bar  grill on oct 10 
406 brewery on oct 16 cold 
smoke coee on oct 23 and at 

norris hot springs on oct 31

paleontologist encourages innovation and education
by 
set
h uric
ksince 1982 jack horner has served as the 
curator of paleontology at the museum of 
the rockies and is also the regents professor 

of paleontology for the montana 
university 
system 
one of the most wellknown experts in 
his eld the paleontologist was recently recog
nized by 
newton 
graphic science magazine a 
japanese publication as one of the worlds top 
24 scientists
horner was born and raised in shelby mont 
and had an interest in paleontology from a 

young age he spent several years attending 
university of montana while studying geology 
and zoology before dropping out
it turned out okay i unked out of 
u of 
m and now im a regents professor at ms
u 
horner said
involved in academics since 1975 horners 
rst job was at princeton where he worked as a 
technician in a museum
three years after i got there i found the baby 
dinosaurs at 
egg mountain and published my first 

paper in 
nature so princeton promoted me from 
technician to research scientist and then i worked 
as a research scientist for a couple of years and then 
the museum of the rockies wanted a curator for 
the museum so i applied for it and got it
horners accomplishments include the 
discovery of the rst dinosaur embryos as well 

as discovering the rst dinosaurs eggs in the 
western hemisphere he has contributed greatly 
to the study of dinosaur growth and was a pro
ponent of theories that stated dinosaurs were 
warm blooded and feathered he has published 
and written numerous papers and articles as 

well as several books and served as a technical 
advisor for the popular jurassic park lms
while continuing to study dinosaur growth 
horner is also examining the potential of discov
ering and manipulating latent genes that birds 

may still have since they evolved from dinosaurs
e theoretical question is whether we 
could do it could you bring back a dinosaur 
you cant really bring back an extinct dinosaur 

but we could bring back some of the characteris
tics of a dinosaur horner said its about trying 
to gure out the transition between dinosaurs 

and birds birds really are dinosaurs but they 

have evolved so many new characteristics they 
are very dierent from one another because 
birds are closely related to dinosaurs they still 
carry a lot of dinosaur d
na we cant nd 
dna in extinct dinosaurs so if we want to bring 
back a dinosaur the best way to do it is to just 

use a bird
horner continued ere are a couple of 
things involved in this 
one is to see if we can 
do it and it is also a great way to study the 
evolution of birds from dinosaurs and to learn 

about the developmental processes involved in 
modifying an animal
horners interest into genetic modification ex
tends into other animals as well he suggested that 
most domestic animals already exist as genetically 
modified organisms so it would be reasonable to 

use genetic knowledge to make more
horner said that he has never been an orthodox 
thinker  something he attributes to his dyslexia 

 which has allowed him to think outside the box 
his entire life he sees his ideas whether success
ful or not as ways to encourage others including 

students to think outside the box as well
i like to come up with dierent ways of get
ting people to think dierently school teaches 

you to think the same way you go into class 
and you learn what everyone else has learned 
and then you are set on a path that basically 

everyone else has been on you can lengthen 
than path but why not make some new paths 
horner asked 
everything we need to know is 
on our phone 
every bit of information in the 
world is accessible by phone  what we should 
be doing is teaching people how to use informa
tion and how to challenge it because a whole 

bunch of it is wrong
horner concluded by saying that of all his 
lifes work and accomplishments he is most 

proud of his students and the work they do
everything on display at the museum 
there is science behind it  all of it was done 
here by either our students or our sta and 

it is the only university museum in the world 

where everything was done at the place where 
it is shown horner said thats what im proud 
of im proud of our students doing world class 
research that you can go to other museums and 
see there as well as here

university 
council votes 
in student bill of rightsby 
tyle
r stitt
following a unanimous vote at the 
oct 7 university council meeting 
the ms
u student bill of rights was 
officially adopted 
the bill of rights has been des
tined for success since 87 percent 
of students voted in favor of it last 

spring when the student body 

voted on the issue once more along
side the 2015 homecoming ballot 

support grew to 91 percent 
levi birky asms
u president as 
of oct 1 represented asms
u at 
the 
university council meeting 
we arent creating new policy 

birky said were just putting it in a 
finite document 
the new bill of rights doesnt 
actually provide any new rights for 
ms
u students instead it serves as 
a document that outlines what stu
dents have the right to rather than 

the student code of conduct which 
defines what students can not do 
one of the original writers 
student dillion haskell suggested 

the idea to current asms
u senate 
president josh soares and former 
asms
u senate vice president billy 
dove over breakfast we felt that 

many students werent always aware 

of their rights haskell said and 

we felt it necessary to help make 
many of them more easily available 
to students and the administration 

our primary motivation was to take 
various rights students had from a 
number of other sources and com
bine them into one clear document 
almost a year later that conversa
tion has evolved into official policy 

we expected a unanimous vote 

soares said and thats what we 

got soares continued 
the bill of 
rights was just something that had 

to happen and we just happened to 
be the ones who wrote it

on 
oct 6 at 5 pm half of the room was 
already lled with members of the boze
man community and colleagues of 
gerald

semesters continuation of the jake jabs 
college of business and 
entrepreneurships 
david

executive speakers forum 
aer nishing his tour of the new business 

building jerry 
grinstein moseyed into 
the front of the room noting the size of the 
crowd before him as he started his address 
ceo of delta air 
lines until 2007 a 
former nonexecutive chairman of agilent 
technologies from 19992002 the chair
man and c
eo of burlington 
northern inc 
and the c
eo of western airlines before 
that among many other things 
grinstein 
has quite the repertoire of experience he 

took over delta when the company was in 
a deep nancial crisis 
to regain the trust 
of his employees he took a serious pay cut 
well below preceding executives multimil
lion dollar compensation packages and 

bonuses picking the highest paid pilot in 

the business 
grinstein matched his salary 

telling his employees we are going to get 

out of this together
e importance of 
ethics in business 
leadership was the focus of the lecture 
which he humbly introduced saying a 

ceo lecturing on ethics is as eective as 
donald 
trump on humility
grinstein began explaining how to make 
sure students nd future employers that t 

our values as you make decisions about 

what companies you want to join youll 
focus on the leadership  that makes the 
fundamental dierence when working 

for the 
university of washingtons board of 
regents as they searched for a new univer
sity president he made a list of ve things 
that the future leader should embody he 
thinks these ve things are something all 

students should evaluate when searching 

for their rst job being empathy integrity 
intelligence track record and the question 
do people want to follow this person
according to 
grinstein the management 
of a company should be able to understand 

their employees be relatively transparent 

with their operations and own up to mis
takes have a practical sense of what people 
want have appropriate reactions to past 

successes or failures and just be someone that 
others want to move forward with he urged 
students to be aware of their own legacies 

sayingyou are now building your own 

track records  those are things people are 

going to look at he said that with regards 
to satisfaction with your jobs and employ
ers you should ask yourself are you happy 
when your boss walks into your oce if 

the answer is no now you have an idea
grinstein did not approve of companies 
overpayment of c
eos you cannot justify 
2000 times what the employee gets  you 

dont bring that much value to it  when a 

failed c
eo gets 27 million its a scandal 
is is representative of the true culture 

of a company which 
grinstein says is very 

important to look at c
eos get generous 
salaries  i dont know why they get bonuses 

for doing the right thing 
to prove how 
much he values his employees and cares 

about them he gets on their level to build 

trust 
on his rst day working for delta he 
drove up in his wifes prius parked in the 
employee lot took a low salary commu
nicated with his employees and still didnt 
win them over immediately 
grinstein cared 

about them and wanted to make sure they 

knew it
now residing in seattle with his wife 
grinstein nds his escape through collecting 

art y shing hunting and books we like 

to put a y at the end of a line and throw 
it at a thing with a tiny brain and watch it

professor of creative writing at 
the 
university of 
north caro
lina wilmington spoke at the 

museum of the rockies on 
oct 
1 as a part of the college of 
letters and sciences western 
lands 

and peoples initiative 
gessners 
talk was titled 
edward abbey 

wallace stegner and the future 

of the american west 
gessners 
latest book all the wild 
that 
remains focuses on these two 

western writers who were the 

subject of his talk  
 gessner began with a personal 
story of how he ended up in the 

west following a bout with 

testicular cancer 
gessner was 
accepted into the creative writ
ing program at the 
university 
of colorado in boulder 
gladly 

leaving his hometown of worces

ter mass he drove his brothers 

unregistered buick west 
gessner 
recalled the euphoric feeling of 

seeing the rocky mountains for 

the first time relating what he 

saw to 
edward abbeys first en
counter with the iconic western 

horizon
calling himself an appren
tice literary westerner 
gessner 
became exposed to the literature 

of the west including 
edward 
abbey and wallace stegner i 
was learning my place but i was 

also reading my place 
gessner 
explained
these writers eventually 
became the focus of 
gessners 
latest book all the wild 
that 
remains which he quoted 

throughout the talk discussing 
the biographies of both abbey 

and stegner 
gessner related 
these authors to their place and 

relationship to the west abbey 

is one archetype of the west 

the guy who comes from the 

east sees those mountains and 
is born again stegner is born in 

the west and stegner lives this 

migrant western childhood
quoting pieces of stegner 
gessner discussed environmental 
factors such as aridity and water 

which 
gessner relates to todays 
situation also discussing stegn
ers political influence on western 

issues 
gessner recognized the 
true impact stegner had relating 

to his own experience in nature 

gessner then discussed environ
mental issues facing the west by 

reading excerpts from all the 

wild that remains bringing up 
issues like higher temperatures 

pine bark beetles and snow pack 

fires and carbon
moving to 
edward abbey 
gessner discussed abbeys intel
ligence and relation to the west 

as an author 
gessner explained 
he writes about the physical 

landscape in a way that for me 

makes me want to get out into it 

still abbey convinced people 

to commit acts of environmental 

terrorism and 
gessner contin
ued ive never seen literary 
influence at work the way i saw 
in abbey
gessner discussed what he has 
taken from abbey and the bold 

tactics he used to advocate for 

his cause 
gessner said abbeys 
honesty was one of the most 

important aspects its a rare act 

to be able to make words on the 
page convey a personality and 

that to me is his genius
comparing the two authors 
gessner discussed their impact 
stegner i think brings to the 

current world a way to think 

in a big picture way remember 

largeness is a lifelong matter of 

connecting the dots and think
ing about the big picture west 

abbey brings kind of a refreshing 

boldness honesty and courage 

that is exciting to me
gessner ended his talk by 
discussing stegner and abbeys 

deaths and their relationship 

to their overall influences 
the 
western 
lands and peoples

75004county commission changes polling places students voting rights groups concerned
by 
tim
ot
hy adams
e republicancontrolled 
gallatin county commission and 
gallatin county clerk and recorder 
charlotte mills again told local 
voting rights groups and citizens 
tuesday that they had no plans to 
make changes or accommodations to 
hope 
lutheran church as montana 
states nearest polling place forward 
montana and a coalition of non
prot groups and citizens had previ

ously asked for the 
gallatin county 
commission to consider reversing its 

decision during the 2012 redistrict
ing to remove a polling place from 

the ms
u campus or provide some 
funding to help shuttle students to 

the church polling place on 
election 
day commissioners have adamantly 
denied their requests and insisted 
doing so would provide special treat
ment to students over other 
gallatin 
county residents
forward montana and asms
u state 
legislature director 
garrett 
lankford a senior in political 

science have maintained that the 
new polling place location at hope 
lutheran church puts ms
u students 
in more danger ey continued 
explaining that students are seri

ously inconvenience since they must 
now travel over two miles along 
roads with no shoulders traveled by 

vehicles traveling 60 miles per hour 
or faster sometimes in the dark and 
cold of winter  students were able to 

vote at bobcat stadium before the 

2014 election mills and the county 
discontinued voting there in order 
to consolidate precincts save county 

money respond to trends in mail 
voting and because of internet and 
power connectivity problems at the 

stadium in the past  
most recently mills and county 
commissioners have proposed mov
ing an additional two precincts to 

the hope 
lutheran church from 
the 
gallatin county fairgrounds 
to accommodate renovations at the 

fairgrounds 
kiah abbey forward montanas 
bozeman director says this will only 

work to disenfranchise more stu
dents from the election process since 

more students who could previously 
use the streamline bus service to ride 
directly from campus to the fair
grounds will now have to nd a way 
to travel at night to hope 
lutheran 
church to vote on 
election day 
abbey questioned the move by the 

commission saying why does it 

have to be so reactive why cant we 
be more proactive when it comes to 
the safety of our bike and pedestrian 

trac abbey further stated she 

thinks that it is the responsibility of 
the commission to not only make 
sure our elections just and fair but 

safe friendly and accessible to help 
encourage voter turnout
lankford echoed the sentiment 
and said he will most likely approach 
the asms
u senate with a resolu
tion to garner support in hopes of 

changing the commissions views 

with so many students relying on 
walking biking and the streamline 
to get around town he said that the 

commissions attitude and lack of 

receptiveness to improving access for 
students was a dereliction of duty 
to those who are most vulnerable to 

being excluded from the democratic 

process  
lankford and marianne brough 
director of operations for asms
u 
also pointed to thousands in student 

fee funding of the streamline bus 

which they say shows students are 
helping shoulder the cost for the rest 
of the countys citizens to utilize pub
lic transportation while students 
organizations like hrdc and the 
city all contribute to the stream
line bus system the county puts in 

nothing and according to 
lankford 
and brough should contribute to 
populations it receives nancial 

benets from   
both abbey and 
lankford said 
they have acted in good faith for 

months in trying to quell commis

sion concerns while some conserva
tives believe that the organizations 

are primarily trying to increase 

voter turnout for democrats abbey 
pointed to several other initiatives 
forward montana and 
lankford 

have helped organize like a city 

commission candidate forum sched
uled for 
oct 14 and voter guides 
distributed to students weve 

denitely acted in good faith in deal
ing with the commissions concerns 
abbey said
lankford asserted that the county 
has not been doing the same point
ing to the short notice commission
ers provided he and abbey for the 

commissions latest meeting in which 
the issue was again brought up ac

cording to 
lankford local political 
party ocials were given almost a 
months notice of the commission 

taking up the matter while notices 

in the bozeman daily chronicle 
and to he and abbey who have been 
involved in the process for months 

were done just days before making it 
dicult to get possible supporters to 
give feedback  
ultimately the county still has 
time to change its mind although 
commissioners seem to have made 
clear at this point they have no 

intention of doing so abbey says the 
polling location can be changed be
tween now and next may and hopes 
to continue to educate students and 

build enough support to sway the 
commission by growing the coalition 
of organizations and people asking 

the county to nd some way to al
leviate concerns and possible dangers 
associated with travel to the church

opini
onbobcat by choice  athlete by rightsports are as imperative to the college 
institution as music and art programs 
if not in some regards more so it is no 
surprise that collegiate sports are increasing 
in both nancial focus and student interest 
most universities operate as businesses and 

will make decisions that directly inuence 

revenue similarly we as students 
have made the decision to spend 
incredible sums of money on tu
ition and school expenses in hopes 
of increasing future income with a 
degree collegiate sports particu
larly football can be major sources 

of revenue in a universitys business 

scheme and investments like the 

remodeling of the bobcat stadium 
are becoming more necessary than 
desired ese investments are bringing about 

concerns that too much focus is being placed 

on collegiate sports and some are calling to 
reverse the trend however this is a very nar
row perspective as the athletics department 
encompasses a broad spectrum of value
in addition to a growing student popula
tion the success of the msu football team 

has prompted structural changes to the uni

versitys stadium e south end zone was re
cently reconstructed increasing the stadiums 

capacity and allowing for a greater volume of 

ticket sales and other earnings which would 
pay into the reconstruction project an in
crease in capacity and again the success of the 
football team has led to attendances exceeding 
21000 on multiple occasions 
collegiate sports have much more to oer a 
university than ticket sales as spectators and 
fans of msu athletics students alumni and 
the community as a whole are provided the 
opportunity to build maintain and strength
en ties with the university ese ties are what 
motivate individuals like the late bill wurst 
an alumnus who recently le 4 million to the 

university to keep msu in mind 
e value of the athletics department is 
immeasurable at value extends also into 
education an area of focus bobcat athletics 
takes seriously in recent years the msu ath
letics teams have broken records in academ
ics by maintaining a collective grade point 

average over 30 for 27 consecutive semesters 
is demonstrates both the departments 
attitude toward academics and its overall 
success in academic achievement moreover 
some students who otherwise could never 
go to school are provided that opportunity 
through athletic scholarships e decision 

to distribute scholarships is not taken lightly 

as student athletes maintain an 85 percent 

graduation success rate as opposed to the 

overall universitys roughly 49 percent at 

msu athletics are also motivating factors in 
student enrollment and retention
additionally the athletics depart
ment is a promotion of student 

health a key contributor to rising 

obesity rates is a lack of physical 

inactivity advocating involvement 

in collegiate sports could help 

reduce the incidence of obesity in 

the collegeaged populace which 

has tripled in the united states from 
19912004 in a society where obesity has 

been labeled an epidemic i believe the wrong 

course of action would be to stray from an 

athletic mindset 
college sports are neither a waste of time 
nor a waste of money yes on the surface 

sports may seem like just another form of 

entertainment e same can be said about 

music and arts yet while some consider 

sports noncontributable to society based on 

that idea there is no consideration of music 

and arts to be without value while it is true 

that many student athletes do not become 

professionals student musicians artists 

photographers scientists and so on do not 

nd careers on a professional level concordant 

with their collegiate activities either yet there 

is very little consideration of music and arts 

to be wastes perhaps this doublestandard 

can be attributed to the success of collegiate 

sports we do not see tens of thousands in 

the attendance of an orchestral performance 
aer all nevertheless it is wrong to degrade a 
collegiate organization based on its success or 
lack thereof furthermore it is wrong to want 
to deprive any student of the opportunity for 

a future in their area of interest based on the 
favorability of the odds presented to them 
can a bobcat athlete become a professional 
we would never know if they were not given 
the chance should one of my peers decide to 

place less focus on sciences or performing arts 
to better their athletic abilities and strengthen 
the team that directly aids my university i am 
in full support in pursuit of a profession no 
one should be denied support

opini
on  9sports 1 academics 
still in progress
i realized for the rst time two years ago that 
not all sports teams in seattle were called 
the mariners as one might imagine im not 
a huge sports fan i knew i wasnt alone in that 
when ocks of other students were asking 
the same question i was the morning aer 

the super bowl who won more specically 

what sport is that i had hoped that 
college would bring the mental shi 
high school had lacked and that 

academics and football might nally 
be valued for their respective worths 
unfortunately i struck out and 
football once again took precedence 
in both the minds and hearts of 

most students 
it seems incomprehensible that an 
institution centered around learning 

would have such a focus on one sport but it 

is just par for the course colleges across the 

nation have proved it to be true e university 
can push academics as much as it likes but 
until the students recognize education to be 

of equal or greater value to athletics msu is 
playing defense trying to validate learning e 
students have dropped the ball when it comes 

to remembering why they are here college 

should be an intellectually stimulating envi
ronment devoted to broadening opportunities 
for the students in the future e entertain
mentdriven emphasis on athletics takes away 
from the integrity of the learning experience 
it would be eversoeasy to ignore this 
inequality and ip a few pages over to the 

sports section but that would only further the 
disparate interests as it is impossible to nd 

an academic section in this newspaper ere 

isnt a section dedicated to the lifechanging 
research done by msu students e students 
who placed second in an academic quadrath
lon the collaborators who pieced together the 
most detailed life history of any dinosaur ever 
known the participants in a national biomedi

cal research workshop hosted by msu have 

all received far less recognition than they 
deserve from the school media and students
i dont mean to imply that sports are bad 
just because i dont idolize athletes like tom 
brady yes i did just google famous sports 

people doesnt mean that others are wrong 

to do so sports are an incredible way for the 
overly athletic students of msu to demon
strate their physical prowess as msu is such 

an active campus it is awesome to see what all 
these humans are capable of most of which 
hurts me to even watch e problem arises 
when sports divert the focus from education
students are willing to put thousands of 
hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars 
into their education because they know knowl
edge is intrinsically valuable years of ingrained 

lectures from parents remind kids that college 
opens more doors in the longterm 

yet the atmosphere on campus 
doesnt necessarily reect that e 
number of students and members of 

the community that will cheer at the 
football game is dramatically greater 
than those that will make an appear
ance at the celebration of student 
research in april ere are countless 
games to attend but only one event 
dedicated to appreciating the hard 
work of msus undergraduate scholars
for majority of the msus sports academ
ics remains the focus of the athletics program 

bobcat athletics has rigorous standards 
academically and has received recognition for 
the success of its students in 2014 the gradu
ation success rate for the athletic program was 

85 percent which is drastically higher than the 
overall msu graduation rate 496 percent of 
students who graduated within six years 
one 
of the goals for the program is to maintain an 

average studentathlete gpa of 30 or better 
for the most part they have fullled these 
goals so well that president waded cruzado 
has commended them and looked into ways 
of replicating the athletic academic programs 
in a campus wide eort to raise graduation 
rates football however does not fall into this 
category of great success despite receiving 
the most publicity the football team failed to 
meet the minimum gpa goal at msu with 
a team average of only 276 this last year e 
athletics program has run interference for the 
academic failings of the football team in the 
past but that is simply condoning the football 
teams priorities of sports rst school second 
e members of the athletic program 
at msu have so many wonderful qualities 
outside of their athletic abilities it might be 
time to focus on those qualities in conjunction 

with their season stats when game day ar
rives it would be refreshing to see gpa listed 
next to the weight of the player 
or focus on 
the cap on cancer promoted by msu and 

bobcat athletics someday the mvp award 
will gather dust and biceps will atrophy but 
knowledge and experiences will live on

ursday october 8 2015
msu students are really feeling the bern
with the 2016 election ramping 
up students are becoming more 
invested in getting their peers more 
informed and active 
one of 
these groups is ms
u students 
for bernie sanders 
their goal is 
to get students more politically 

active within the community 

as well as dispel misinformation 

and political rumors that have 

been circulating lately 
as with any group in support 
of a specific candidate they are 

obviously biased however the entire 

bernie campaign is about cutting the 

closedmindedness out of politics in fa
vor of a system that will help all ameri

cans he plans on raising the minimum 

wage to 15 an hour for college stu
dents providing affordable healthcare 
for everyone defending womens and 
lg
bt rights and most importantly 
making college free for everyone all of 

these reforms will help students to pre
pare for the future with less of the social 

or financial burdens modern society puts 

on them
unlike many candidates he isnt do
ing this to be popular or garner votes 

he is doing this because it is actually 

what he believes in bernie isnt about 

playing political games and his voting 

record backs up his firm support for all 

of these ideas going back before he ever 

even became a congressman he has 

consistently voted on huge issues like 

his stance against capital punishment 

maintaining social security and break
ing up big banks
bernie has become something of a 
political underdog with his refusal to use 

super pacs to fund his campaign as he 

firmly believes in taking corporate money 

out of politics he is running a true grass

roots campaign raising over 26 million 

dollars in small donations and using that 

as his primary campaign funding
amongst college students bernie is 
giving people who might not feel like 

theyve ever had a politician have their 

back someone to root for in the ms
u student poll from the bozeman daily 

chronicle 27 percent of those polled 

were in support of sanders which is 

more than twice as much the next high
est democratic candidate and over four 

times higher than that of the highest 

republican candidate at catapolooza 

ms
u students for bernie sanders 
received almost 200 email addresses of 

people interested 
students for bernie sanders plans 
on holding events to get students more 
interested in politics and explaining 
why bernie is going to be the 

best candidate for not just 

students but america having 
a politically informed campus 
will allow students to more 

reasonably understand politi
cal issues see through all the 
smoke and noise and come to 
a better conclusion about what 
will benefit them and others 
the most politically
these students are also collaborating 
with montanans for bernie sanders by 
helping coordinate events to get people 
interested 
on the 13th they are hold
ing a livescreening of the democratic 

national debate being held for all ages 
at bar ix people of all parties are in
vited and it will work as an openforum 

for political discussion more informa
tion about their events can be found on 
facebookcomberniemsu
this is all just the club getting 
warmed up though as the elections 
get closer and closer they are going to 
become more and more active in the 
community eventually going door to 
door handing out information and get
ting students to register to vote 
they 
believe that all students should be accu
rately informed on the issues and they 

are trying more ways to get students 

interested 
even if you arent a bernie supporter 
id encourage you to talk to members 

of this club and those like it 
the more 
informed we are as a whole the better 

we will function as a democracy and 
the more fairly everyone will be repre
sented and it will make ms
u and this 
country a better place to live in for all 
of us

 news
e end of every august hearkens 
the arrival of thousands of students to the 
gallatin valley e side eects are well 
known more crowds more trac fewer 
parking spots but something else tends to 
come with the start of the new semester
among sexual assault survivor advocacy 
groups this is the busiest time of the year 
nationally e red zone is the rst six weeks 
of the semester and accounts for a large portion 
of all of the sexual assaults that will occur over 
the school year at could be for a lot of 
reasons if you think about it explained joe 
schumacher education and prevention special
ist for the msu voice center schumacher 
explained that theres a convergence of new 
people seeking new experiences is is espe
cially true for younger students during those 
rst six weeks the majority of these crimes are 
being committed against primarily freshmen 
and sophomores schumacher said possibly 
because theyre seen as nave or as easy targets
possibly even more concerning than the 
rise in sex crime reports is the reporting itself 
sexual assault is one of the most unreported 
crimes there is schumacher said following 
a statistic from the rape abuse and incest 
national network that indicates 68 percent of 
rapes go unreported even a small increase in 
reports of sexual assault could hint at a much 
more sizable jump in actual perpetrations
schumacher stressed that one of the most 
important factors in preventing sexual assault 
is bystander intervention if the community is 
welleducated and willing to help then we can 
take care of each other he said during the red 
zone the voice center tries to combat the 
increase of sexual assault we stepped up our 
awareness eorts our visibility eorts he said 
we went to all of the orientations so we spoke 
to all of the incoming freshmen we went to all 
of the residence halls the night before classes 
started  we talked about prevention and we 
talked about risk reduction strategies
 but sexual assaults arent the only type of 
crime that sees wide variation over the year 
in the city of bozeman a number of other 
crimes see a measurable rise with the start of 
the semester for many of them the rst two 
months see the highest rates with a fallo 
before and aer
 since jan 1 2011 bozeman police have 
received over 233000 calls for service a call 
for service is the term used for a call dispatched 
to an ocer explained deanna foster police 
information specialist at the bozeman police 
department bpd as of sept 31 those calls 
for service resulted in nearly 23000 recorded 
cases a case results from a call for service 
that requires further investigation andor has 
charges involved foster wrote  ese cases 
include everything from warrant arrests to 
trac crimes and homicide
 is data was analyzed by dividing each 
year into the rst two months of school the 
rest of the semester and the summer it was 
further broken out by specic types of crimes 
that were expected to vary considerably before 
being compared see box 1
e results show a modest increase 
of about 12 percent in total case numbers 
between the rst two months of the semester 
versus the entire rest of the year but the major
ity of variation occurs in the suspected crimes 
see box 2
of the selected case types those that 
see the largest increase are assault criminal 
mischief mip and various forms of the 
many of these see moderate increases from the 
summer but large dropos at the end of the 
twomonth period
 on campus statistics are a bit more 
dicult to manage while the msu police 
department msupd maintains record logs 
their system is not sophisticated enough for 
easy extraction of data by crime type or other 
criteria msupd does have to report crime 
statistics but theyre reported as clery crimes 
as dictated by the clery act which reports 
broad criminal categories one for example 
is liquor law violations is nonspecic 
category includes illegal manufacture posses
sion use sale and so on if however msupd 
wanted to break out the dierent types of 
liquor law crimes they would have to go back 
and review every single clery crime  400 
reports  read the report and determine what 
other classication itd t into said chief of 
msu police robert putzke
 msupd did donate a considerable 
amount of time to do this for the purposes of 
this article e data produced looks similar to 
that in the city from summer to fall we see a 
big uptick in all of our caseload said putzke 
as with bpd august spikes are seen in mip 
drug crimes and the
  while many of the crimes that increase in 
rate are victimless and dicult to curb crimes 
like the can be prevented according to 
putzke the biggest crime  numerical crime 
 we have on campus is the of unsecured 
property being crimes of opportunity putzke 
stressed they can easily be prevented simply by 
securing belongings at means not leaving 
books or a computer unattended at the library 
or in the sub
 e change in fall caseload certainly 
hasnt gone unnoticed by police forces and 
is largely predictable putzke says his ocers 
could be blindfolded in a sense and know 
exactly what september brings police try 
to deter certain expected crimes by stepping 
up patrol  around bike racks for example 
bikes have proven to be a particularly hot 
target for the over the years in the past its 
largely been just unlocked bikes is semes
ter weve seen an uptick in people cutting 
cable locks o said putzke and its not 
just students who fall victim our dean of 
students had his bicycle stolen according to 
putzke matt caires bike was locked with a 
pretty decent cable lock before it was thieved 
near the end of september
 e targeted locked bikes are primarily 
those with small cable locks or other locks that 
can be easily severed with small bolt cutters as 
well as bikes improperly locked with the lock 
only going through the front tire to keep 
bikes safe putzke recommends using a sturdy 
lock especially ushaped locks to lock both 
the front wheel and the frame to the rack
 e rst months of the semester arent the 
only time with increases in crime on campus 
data from msupd reveals that april is also 
a busy month for opportunistic criminals 
students spending hours in the library or other 
study spots tend to leave things laying around 
on tables more than they normally would 
msupd detective sergeant michael stanley 
explained its common for belongings to go 
unattended while students briey duck out to 
grab coee and criminals take advantage before 
the end of the year to swing by the pawn shop 
and get some cash for the road stanley said 
from bikes to books we recover a fair amount 
of stu at pawn shops putzke agreed
its easy to see a correlation with increased 
crime and the start of the semester but its 
critical to note its neither possible nor appro
priate to assign blame to the incoming mass 
of students  or anything for that matter  
with this analysis alone ere are too many 
variables le unexplored and probably most 
importantly many of these numbers are small 
for example the total number of all reported 
sex crimes an already articiallybroadened 
category lumping rape with sexual assault was 
only 55 in 2012 the most voluminous year for 
that group of crimes factoring that against 
the nearly 5000 total cases that year means 
that a variation of just one or two could largely 
change the outcome between time frames in 
a year so even though a crime category may 
show an increase during a certain time of year 
caution must be taken in drawing sweeping or 
dramatic conclusions
e most important conclusion  and 
indeed the only possible one  that can be 
drawn is that every fall there is an increase 
in crime some categories see a greater change 
than others searching for the cause whether 
proximate or ultimate would be nearly 
impossible however simply knowing about 
this phenomena can help decrease its sever
ity consider what crimes you may be at risk 
for and do what can be done to reduce your 
risk and the risk to others regardless of the 
severity of the crime or the size of its increase 
at the start of the semester during this time 
schumacher was adamant that we need to be 
extra vigilant and extra proactive
box 1
 for 2011 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 data from bpd was segmented into three time 
frames summer spanning from midmay to the day before the start of the semester the 
rst two months of school from the rst day of class to oct 31 and the remainder of 
the school year nov 1 to midmay in addition to knowing the total volume of cases in 
each time frame specic categories of crimes hypothesized to increase were tabulated see 
figure x in order to standardize data across windows of time of dierent lengths the 
sum of each case category was divided by the number of days in the time frame yielding 
an average number of cases per day averaging the daily rates across all ve years within 
each window allows for more statistically signicant comparison of the change in crime 
rates from summer to fall to winterspring e total of the brokenout case categories 
averaged vary by as much as 26 percent between the three time windows while the aver
aged sums of the all of the nonselected categories only vary by a maximum of 12 percent 
between time windows

failure in flagstaff cats struggle to get off the plane
footb
all
by davis c
onnelle
yrob ash and the montana state bobcats 
looked ummoxed on saturday against 
the 
northern arizona 
university 
lum
berjacks on both sides of the ball aer a 

performance last week that looks more like 

an aberration than an improvement the de
fense seemed entirely lost against a middling 

lumberjack oense while the cats vaunted 
oense couldnt get the wheels turning 

quickly enough to make up the slack 
aer 
nau opened the game with a 
78 yard drive in less than two minutes it 

looked as though bobcat 
nation would 
have to endure yet another defenseless 

game as apparently the unit that stopped 

cal poly last week decided to take the week 

o and stay in bozeman e two teams 

traded scores for much of the rst half but a 

stop from the 
lumberjack defense aorded 
nau some breathing room and they took a 
2814 halime lead over the cats
 e defense looked absolutely gassed 
and it was only halime and the oense had 

stagnated thus far 
oensive coordinator 

tim cramsey called plays as if ms
u were 
running the wildcat and instead of down
eld passing the bobcats seemed content to 

scramble in the backeld deciding not to 

use his junior quarterback dakota prukop 

to pass the ball as most teams would the 

bobcats elected to use their all star qb as a 
runningback for much of the game for his 

part prukop remains healthy for now but 

taking hit aer hit in what will be a grueling 

season doesnt bode too well 
aer halime things only got worse for 
the cats and the ms
u faithful 
unlike the 
usual version of halime adjustments where 

teams look to correct their rst half mistakes 

the cats decide to instead keep trying the 

exact same thing to see if it might work out 

it did not e defense allowed the 
lumber
jacks to leap to a 4214 lead and the oense 

continued to dink and dunk and squander 

chances and the oensive line looked oen
sive with their terrible pass protection 
when the cats nally connected on one 
of their many deep passes of the evening 

this time to sophomore wideout justin 

paige for 64 yards ash decided  on the 

road and down 22 points  to go for two 

on the conversion which they failed to get 

aer the unsuccessful conversion attempt 

the cats tried for an onsides kick basically 

admitting that their defense couldnt stop 

a nosebleed and that their only chance to 

yet win the game was to keep the ball out 

of naus hands aer the cats did not re
cover the kick the defense gave up another 

short four play drive to extend 
naus lead 
to 29 points with 10 minutes to go finally 

the bobcat oense remembered that they 

are actually really good at football and 

managed to score three touchdowns in 
four and a half minutes to close the gap 

but aer trying to onsides kick the ball 

and instead kicking the football equivalent 

of a slow grounder to the shortstop the 

bobcats were out of luck and those fans 

still watching the disaster were nally al
lowed to go do more productive and heart

healthy activities
prukop nished the game with 399 passing 
yards on 22 of 35 attempts and also ran the ball 

and inexplicable 21 times for 54 yards  only 

averaging 26 yards per carry  as many as the 

other two real runningbacks did throughout 

the game it would be hard to say which 

aspect of the bobcat defense looked worse 

between the run and the pass ey gave 
up 254 passing yards on just 18 comple
tions while being gashed for 252 yards on 

the ground e unit looks dierent and 

unready to play week to week e only 

consistent thing to blame is the coaching in 

four games this season the cats have come 

out of the gates looking unprepared in three 

of those and that is simply not acceptable 

for a team that claims to be aspiring toward 

a national championship 
e cats return home this week to play 
an underperforming sacramento state 

squad next weekend in a game that they 

should and need to win in order to keep 

their playoff hopes alive 
the game kicks 
off at 5 pm this saturday

at the beginning of the season 
the montana state cross country 

team set some high goals with a 

double win at the montana invi

tational the cats took a step to
ward realizing those goals after 

the bozeman invitational coach 

lyle weese preached he was look
ing for continual improvement as 

the season went on he has to be 

satisfied with the improvement

ebbas a climber i recognize that climbing is 
mostly about looking cool 
guess what can 
contradict all those style points you rack up 
wearing your hipster jeans and ray bans clip
ping your chalk bag and climbing shoes to the 
outside of your backpack around campus you 
know where you can put those shoes instead 

inside your pack your shoes and homework 

will in fact t inside your backpack its what 
backpacks were made for putting things inside 

them not clipping them to the outside of them
 maybe some of you have reasons to clip 
things to the outside of your backpack your 

feet stink and therefore your climbing shoes 

stink chalk will get everywhere if you keep 

your chalk bag inside of your pack 
no one will 
know youre a climber if you keep that stu 

inside of your pack 
lucky for you i have some 
simple remedies for such ailments
climbing shoes smell awful its a well
known fact 
nothing like a leather rubbery 
aquarium for your feet to get that funk level 
up so you put them on the outside of your 

pack because you denitely cant stink up the 
inside of your backpack right perhaps you 
dont know  being accustomed to the gnarly 

funk of your own climbing shoes and all  that 

clipping those things to the outside of your 
backpack funks up everyone elses space too 
backpacks hold in all those gross smells that 

otherwise will wa up the nose of the cute girl 
sitting in front of you in calculus 
not a great 
way to swoon her why not put them inside of 
your pack 
keeping that smell contained can 
yes lead to a stench of nuclear grunge factor so 

heres what you do 
take out your calculus stu 
inside the gym when putting your climbing 

shoes away at way when youre sitting down 

in class you have your intellectual stu at the 

ready and the funk hidden away for good
what about the chalk bag you ask a simple 
x is in store a plastic ziplock bag just put 

your chalk bag inside and zip it up put it in 

your pack and move on simple ingenious and 

even doable on a college budget please note 
plastic bags also work for climbing shoes and 
keeping that funk level down inside your pack
now the hardest of all the problems 
no one 
will know youre a climber if you dont have 
that stu clipped to the outside of your pack 
how will they know youre cool i have never 

clipped climbing shoes and a chalk bag to the 

outside of my backpack and i still believe i am 

cool do others probably not but that doesnt 

matter clipping shoes to the outside of packs 
contradicts being cool completely making you 
seem more like a goober than a rock star ose 

pumped up kicks dangling from your rucksack 

seem like an act of desperation  a hope that 
people will recognize youre a climber and your 
esteemed level of radness
we have the opportunity to revolutionize 
our campus 
lets come together and put our 
shoes inside our packs 
not only will putting 
them in the pack stop annoying the larger ma
jority of students who dont climb but i assure 

you that stowing those rubbery ballet slippers 
will make you look cooler too and what climb
er doesnt want to look cool
please stop clipping shoes to the outside of your pack

there are many alternative options to clipping climbing shoes to the outside of your backpack

for that riley said from there 

it was a well played match by us 

and statistically we did some great 
things the dierence was we gave 

up some runs of points that allowed 

un
d to win the match 
un
d went on to win three consecu
tive close matches with scores of 

2521 2522 and 2519 e team 

is growing in their ability to stay 

focused on the right things and to 

keep a clear mind when pressured 

riley said 
keeping that mind 
calm and only focused on what will 

help us during those runs of points 

is something that we need to get 

better at and they are doing it it 

is tough because it takes time and 

patience to conquer that mind but 
the more they do it the less runs of 

points we will give up
e cats will host southern 
utah on 
oct 8 in shroyer 
gym at 
7 pm is week we are going to 

focus a lot on our passing and de
fense as we are making some switch
es defensively in regards to where 

some people will be playing riley 

said we also have more informa
tion statistically as we have had a set 

lineup over the past four matches so 

we will dive into the numbers to see 

where we need to get better by rota
tion defensively and oensively

year spring 2010 when jersey shore was 

still a thing the bobcat mens

e cats had

the second half

the cheer squad

to all of the excitable 
temperamental and perhaps drunken college

guess what happened immedi
ately some balls began to rain down on the

assessed a technical foul which gave the 
griz
zlies two free throws

the game though they 

havent beaten the

kelly roberti and the essence of jazz
by 
keeg
an grady
if you had happened to walk 
into plonk wine bar this past 
saturday you would have been hit 

rst with a deep rumble in the 

midst of wine glasses clinking gen
tly people chattering about noth
ing and waiters itting from table 

to table the room vibrated with a 

bottomless melody standing near 

the doorway you wouldnt be able 

to see the source but chances are 

youd know the sound  a bass
e bass in question was in the 
hands of 
kelly roberti if you 
have been paying any attention to 

local music in the past 15 years 

you probably have heard the name 

go by if 

youre lucky 

youve 

managed 

to hear that 

bass live 

if youre 

smart 

youve 

heard it 

more than 

once but 

to say local 

music is 

to mislead 

slightly  roberti is by no means 

a simple hometown bassist he has 

played with everyone from sonny 

rollins to ray brown to 
tommy 
flanagan e 
los angeles 
times 
even called him the heir appar
ent to charles mingus robertis 

career has been long varied and 

extremely prolic
on meeting him though one 
doesnt immediately see the image 

of the consummate jazz musi

cian  no threepiece suit no 

cigarette dangling from the lips 

he has a friendly smile a rm 

handshake and a quiet condence 

to his demeanor he speaks soly 

and listens intently when you 

speak he is a chef and a poet and 

overall he seems to live simply 

happily and quietly but when 

the subject turns to jazz his eyes 
light up he reminisces about the 

old days playing gigs 250 nights a 

year being constantly on the road 

feeling the raw energy of music 

he laments the current state of 

jazz and you realize he is from 

a very dierent era we never 

had sheet music he explains 

you learned the song by playing 

all those shows and it got inside 

you
if you arent an avid jazz fan 
the names of robertis musical 

partners may not impress you 

but what impresses anyone is 

watching him play  it is a visual 

performance as well as an audi

tory one he feels the music with 

the entirety of his body his eyes 
closed and 

his ngers 

ying e 

phoenix 

tattooed 

on his le 

hand seems 

to soar over 

the bass 

neck pia
nist 
keith 
jarrett is 

famous 

for vocal
izing during 
performances and roberti does 

the same thing  he calls it let
ting the music come tumbling 

forward he throws his head 

back eyes clenched as if in pain 

then leans forward and embraces 

the bass his lips humming the 

same melody thats singing out of 

the wood 
eric funk a ms
u professor 
and composer described robertis 

music as immediately honest  

i never have to guess what hes 

thinking or feeling he plays 

directly from his heart mind and 

soul hes technically limitless and 

always expressively capable he 

says 
listening to robertis record
ings one certainly does get that 

feeling e music is spontaneous 

changeable deep and vital funk 

puts it more eloquently hes 
like life itself sometimes broken 

sometimes harsh sometimes joy
ous sometimes hurt he mirrors 

his experience and the experiences 

of others
life itself can be tough roberti 
was diagnosed in july with lung 

cancer e concert at plonk was 

a community fundraiser for his 

treatment cancer is a destructive 

disease  chronic and vicious it 

tears lives apart like the organs it 

infects but roberti is not afraid 

of the future he says he is still 

plotting a course to carry him 

through and plans to live as much 
as possible 
nor has the disease 
taken a hold of the music playing 

makes me feel good he explained 

you can get lost in the music 

nd your center and forget all the 

bullsht that goes with this dis

ease en he laughed and said 

tell those people not to smoke i 
didnt want to be yul brynner a 

reference to the famous actor who 

died of lung cancer in 1985
support local music he said 
later his voice emphatic address

ing the public we have such 

great music here and people need 

to understand how hard these 
people work to get to that level 

go out and hear live music espe
cially jazz buy cds
by the time i ducked out of 
plonk there had been no stop in 

the steady ow of business and 

food people still lled the narrow 

bar and the buzz of humanity 

had not quieted in the least but 

over all the chatter the bass still 

thrummed  raw elemental 

occasionally painful and heart

achingly beautiful e street was 

dark but even outside you could 

still hear the sound of music low 

and strong against the night
hes like life itself 
sometimes broken 
sometimes harsh 
sometimes joyous 
sometimes hurt he 
mirrors his experience 
and the experiences of 
others

inside outwhat if your emotional stateofbeing 
hinged on the competency of freewilled

or to 
put it in a slightly less insidious man
ner what if your emotions had feelings 

of their own youd have one heck of a 

movie plot thats for sure inside 
out 

follows a preteen girl named riley 

adjusting to a move to san francisco her 

emotions personified by little creatures 

inside of her brain and the brains of 

all characters in the film are working 

overtime to keep her happy however 

when joy and sadness are lost from head
quarters the other emotions  fear 

disgust and anger  are left in control 

the film follows joy and sadness as they 
try to find their way back home while 

simultaneously following rileys journey 

from childhood to emotionally complex

starred in this genrebending thriller that 
received nearly unanimous ravereviews 

a married couples fairly conventional 

lives are turned on their heads when 

a mysterious acquaintance from the 

husbands past arrives and starts giving 

the couple gifts his motives unclear and 

their shared past shrouded in mystery 

the gift weaves a tale of sinister secrets 
and horrible consequences
if that sounded a little vague it should 
 the less you know about the details of

the satisfaction 
of the gift lies in its twists and turns 
which come at a fiery worldshattering

word thriller and think could i not 

have my intelligence insulted today 

then this is the film for you 
the gift 
is smart enough to give the genre a good 

name and its got enough bite to keep 

you entertained definitely worth a

trainwreck
trainwrecks title refers to its

trainwreck follows the story of a 
woman exceedingly cynical with respect 

to monogamy  onenightstands are 

a manynight occasion but anything 

approaching a genuine relationship is 

to be avoided at all costs 
that is until 
she meets a congenial sports doctor who 

gives her all the feels suddenly our 

commitmentphobic protagonist is faced

ee
 cronklet me preface this by saying that i 
too was once a 
netflix til i die kind 
of girl but then one cold college night 
netflix failed me i desperately needed to 
see one specific film and 
netflix didnt 
carry it side note dont skip class on 

movie day especially when the movie 

is an impossibletofind 
german art 
piece from the 70s i was forced to test 

the waters of a different stream hulu 

carried the film i was looking for but 

only on hulu plus i started the free 

trial expecting to cancel my subscription 

at the weeks end but here we are over a 

year and a half later and im still enjoy
ing the benefits of hulu plus
now dont me get wrong 
netflix will 
always be my first love but if you claim 

netflix is life without even knowing 
your other options im going to judge 

you the way my mom judges people who 

marry the first person they date so make 

an informed decision
cost 799 per month
pros
 theres a huge catalog of 
streamable content and you can binge
watch hours of television also their 

original programming is top notch
cons  
theres a severalmonth delay 
between your favorite show airing on 

tv and it getting uploaded to 
netflix 
so if you miss an episode on 
tv 
netflix doesnt have your back also the 
service just lost thousands of movies 
to hulu namely 
the hunger 
games 
films wolf of wall street the 
rocky films and anything else under 

the umbrella of the recentlyexpired 
contract they had with 
epix
conclusion 
netflix still reigns 
supreme but with the direction its 
going its practically becoming a dif
ferent entity 
original programming is 
a main priority for the streaming giant 
and with amazing shows like 
orange 
is the 
new black house of cards 
and daredevil one can see why in 
addition to a swath of original films 
netflix has four more marvel shows 
in the works and plenty of other new 
shows to suit a variety of tastes and 

even though 
netflix just lost its deal 
with 
epix it recently signed a new 
contract with disney so beginning 

in january pixar marvel and other 

disney properties will begin streaming 

sooner however if youre someone 

who likes to stay uptodate with your 

shows 
netflix isnt quite the right 
platform for you
cost 799 per month limited 
commercials 1199 per month no 

commercials or get a limited amount 

of content for free
pros 
stay uptodate with most 
shows as they air or catch up with past 

seasons do so with little to no com
mercial interruption depending on the 

package you purchase 
gain access to 
blockbuster hits 
the hunger 
games 
catching fire impressive indies 
the skeleton 
twins 
nebraska 
and an eclectic mix of classic films 
deemed important by the criterion 
collection 
the rules of the 
game 
anyone
cons 
though growing rapidly 
hulus catalog isnt as expansive as 
netflixs 
their 
tv options are somewhat 
lacking walking dead fans lament 

also hulus no commercial option is 
at a steeper price than 
netflixs
conclusion 
if you think binge
watching makes you a 
tv junkie 
then well youd probably be right 
but for those junkies so dedicated to 

their shows they cant bear accidental 

spoilers that come with waiting months 

for a show to pop up on 
netflix hulu 
is the platform for you and with the 

recent additions to their movie catalog 

hulu is quickly becoming a force for 

netflix to reckon with
cost 49 per year student member
ship 99 per year regular member
ship
pros 
get access to shows that arent 
streamed anywhere else like a plethora 
of hb
o series as well as quality 
original programming 
transparent 
won a couple of 
golden 
globes a while 
back in addition get a number of 

added benefits like the everpopular 
free 2day shipping
cons 
the site is somewhat difficult 
to navigate at least when compared 

to other streaming websites and 

while the student membership is quite 

the bargain the regular membership 

amounts to more than 
netflix and 
hulu per month even though they 

offer similar or in the case of 
netflix 
more content also even with a prime 

membership current seasons of shows 

often cost extra money to watch
conclusion 
streaming aside if 
youre a student you should probably 

have prime for the shipping  after a 

few textbook orders it pays for itself 

pretty quickly and youll get 
tv and

on friday 
oct 2 the 1980s came 
back fans queued up in front of brick 
breeden many of them old timers 

becoming teenagers again for one night 

fans from the more recent generations 

were huddled up with their older family 

members whispering excitedly when 

asked why they were attending who 

they most looked forward to seeing 

people answered with an exhilarated 

shout of def 
leppard 
while styx and 
tesla also appeared 
that night def 
leppard was easily the 
most anticipated famous for their 

highly talented onearmed drummer 

rick the thunder 
god allen and be
ing one of the most popular bands of the 

80s many fans were thrown back to the 

days when they would daydream about 

being in the band themselves 
thinking 
about what they would do if they could 

meet the bands in attendance fans said 

everything from the generic get an au
tograph to the more entertaining share 

a doobie many of the fans also stated 

that they would have loved to just share 

a drink with the bands
the show opened with 
tesla a lesser 
known hair metal band formed in 1981 

styx a popular 80s rock band played 

second with such wellloved songs as 

too much 
time on my hands and 
come sail away headliners def 
lep
pard wrapped up the concert rocking 

out to applause and screams from the 

animated audience 
many of the fans hailed from neigh
boring cities of 
great falls and bill
ings and many were locals from here in 

bozeman as well 
the locals included 
becca brown a fellow student here at 
ms
u and her father dan brown a local 
high school teacher much like myself 

browns father had raised her on def 

leppard albums
other audience members most of 
whom were over 30 came to reminisce 

about their young adulthood many 

of these teenagers of the 80s brought 

their own children to the show hoping 

to introduce them to the classics they 

themselves had grown up on much like 

the browns several audience members 

even sported mullet wigs and one group 

of women had teased and sprayed their 

hair into 80s hairstyles and wore neon 
yellow sweaters stating that they heart 
the 80s
towards the end of the show as def 
leppards lead singer joe 
elliott pre
pared for his next song a bra made its 

way to the stage landing at his feet it 

was of a larger size and a bright fiery 

red 
elliott picked it up by a strap and 
asked who had lost their bra he tossed 

it back to the audience member say
ing he didnt want to make trouble he 

joked that the husband of the bra wearer 

would wonder if his wife had left the 

house wearing it and that she would say 

that she did not in fact have a bra on 

when she left and that he was a liar 
the 
audience laughed at the comedic high 

point and 
elliott went on to perform 
his next piece 
as a band that has been together 
since the late 70s it was no surprise to 

see such a variety in the generations in 

attendance whether 16 or 96 there 

is no age limit for a love of music def 

leppard has given us hope that they will 
be back next year for another show in 

bozeman and some hope that the bra 

will make a repeat appearance as well
autumn is here and school is well 
under way 
the leaves are turning a lovely 
shade of orange and there is a slight chill 

in the air 
there is also romance 
ladies 
and gentlemen now is the perfect time to 

find a snugglebuddy for the winter 
the 
best way to do that is with a few fun filled 

and easyontheexpenses dates
halloween is coming up soon as we all 
know 
one of the best things you can do 
with a potential snugglebuddy is to do 

something fun for the holiday you could 

always go to a halloween party or mara
thon horror movies 
those old standbys 
are great but they arent the only things 

you can do
lets be honest most of us havent been 
trickortreating in years but we all love 

costume season and the idea of dressing 

up as someone or something fun why 

not go trickortreating again it is a fun 

and great way to get to know each other 
and have a few laughs you can even pair 

your costumes together or simply surprise 

each other it would certainly be a con
versation starter and you can always save 

those costumes for later use perhaps to 

spice things up in the bedroom
if thats not your thing or you just 
arent up to trickortreating then how 

about a corn maze 
there are several 
corn mazes opening up now that 
octo
ber has hit some even offer more than 

just a maze like hayrides and pumpkin 

patches hay rides provide a great chance 

to cuddle in the chilly weather while 

enjoying the scenery picking pumpkins 

together provides a twofold purpose 

picking pumpkins is fun in and of itself 

and provides you the chance for some 

friendly competition who can find the 

biggest the most round the most awk
wardly shaped pumpkin or any combina
tion thereof it will also almost always 
guarantee a second date you are going 

to have to carve the pumpkins sometime 

after all in fact it can even be turned 

into a three part date were you to decide 

to make real pumpkin pie from scratch 

youll have plenty of pumpkin guts to 

work with for sure
if festive dates arent your thing then 
how about a cheap one say the cost of 

a penny itll actually be a little more 

expensive than that but it does require a 

penny at least 
the idea behind this date 
is simple all you have to do is follow 

directions
the first thing you need to do is get 
your snugglebuddy you two or more 

if this is a group date or you are polyam
orous get dressed in nice clothes you 

dont need to wear an evening gown or a 

tux  just think date clothes but remem
ber to dress for the weather 
next you 
need to assign a direction to each side 
of the penny heads is left tails is right 

or vice versa if you so desire 
then the 
two or more of you need to decide on a 

number of flips if you dont want to do 

that then just flip till you want to stop
now that youve decided all of that you 
can hop in the car and start your adven
ture 
the idea here is that once you are in 
the car you can start flipping right away 

or at a specified destination 
each time 
you come to a crossroads you flip the 

coin 
the coin and your assigned sides 
will tell you whether to turn left or right 

you may also decide to simply go straight 

if you like  whenever you decide to stop 

wherever you find yourself is your date 

destination 
this may seem problematic 
if you wind up outside of city limits 

but it is designed to be played in town 

so make your choices accordingly most 

importantly remember to be yourself be 

respectful and have fun
come sail away with me  back to the 1980s
a penny for your company

governor speaks at the procrastinator
by timothy adams
montana gov steve bullock 
visited msu last ursday oct 8 
to give a talk primarily to students in 
the university honors and political 
science departments in the procras

tinator eatre although bullock 
was scheduled to speak on leadership 
lessons in dealing with the republi

canled state legislature aer arriving 
late bullock informed the audience 
he would be speaking more about 

his personal journey to becoming 
governor and advice to those seeking 

to enter careers in public service  
bullock told the audience he 
believed that his biography would 

provide some insight on how to 
nd successes in the system of 

government bullock related how he 
was born in missoula and grew up 
in helena delivering papers to the 
governors mansion he now inhabits 
he later interned with notable 

politicians like dorothy bradley and 
helped cra policies to put students 
on local school boards across the 
state to give students a larger voice in 
determining local education policy
aer getting his law degree at co
lumbia law school in new york city 

bullock said he envisioned himself 
staying on the east coast in order 
to pay o debts incurred from his 

education but yearned to return to 
montana to do work he is more pas
sionate about bullock came back to 

montana aer working and teaching 
law in washington dc and worked 
in both the secretary of state and at
torney generals oce in helena  
bullock then went on to speak to 
why he decided to run for elected 
oce saying that as a lawyer law 
looks backwards not forwards and 

that instead of working with code 
already on the books he hoped to 
make bigger changes bullock told 

the audience that he wanted to be 
attorney general but lost his race 
to current montana supreme court 

justice mike mcgrath in 2000 in the 
democratic primary upon reec

tion bullock told the audience that 
they should throw out the road map 

in your head of how your life is going 
to go it wont be the one you travel  
he also told the students dont be 

discouraged by detours or setbacks 
many things that happen in your life 
will not be part of the plan bullock 

said he gained valuable lessons from 

his losses and that everyone should 

be willing to take risks and fail  
in 2008 bullock ran again for 
attorney general and was success

ful in his campaign just three years 

later he announced his candidacy for 

governor aer gov brian schweitzer 
was prevented from running again 
from state term limits bullock won 

election to the governors mansion 

in 2012 in a tight threeway race by 

just over 7000 votes 
bullock advised those thinking of 
going into public service to not lose 
sight of what draws you to public 
service he said that the media 

tends to only highlight gridlock de
spite many people working together 

across the aisle for their constitu
ents to nd common ground  he 

advised students to protect their 

reputations which can be espe
cially important in politics bullock 

nished his speech by highlighting 

several accomplishments of his rst 

two legislative sessions including 

leaving the state with a 300 million 

rainy day fund passing medicaid 

expansion and passage of the dis

close act to reveal donors of dark

the parking structure is 129 million according 
to walt banziger director of campus planning 
design and construction banziger estimates the 

nal cost will be lower at 125 million
e rms involved in the construction of the 
structure are primarily montanabased billings 

rm ae architects have partnered with the 

seattle based rm zgf which specialize in edu

construction parking service and university 
police are currently analyzing the parking 

structures of other universities to decide what 

appropriate measures should be taken current

things banziger said
des jardins agreed saying ere are a lot of 
needs right in this center area of campus  all of 
the groups we met with and all of the discussions 
we had across campus said they didnt see those 
needs ever going away so having that structure 
here right in the heart of the campus was ap

complaints by stadium view residents high
light issues with student housing complexby timothy adams
its a notorious problem that has 
seemingly continued unabated due to 
the growth of bozeman and enroll
ment at montana state  a shortage 
of student housing problems with 
unfinished construction and rowdy 
behavior by students offcampus has 
caused headaches for some residents 

of the newlyopened nearby housing 
complex on south 11th avenue sta
dium view student lodging
construction of the community 
area recently resumed and locks were 

installed on the doors to the building 
to increase security carpet is set to be 
laid in the hallways of the buildings 
to help dampen some of the noise of 

cohabitation stadium view commu
nity manager emily green relayed that 

stadium view hired a local security 
firm and contacted bozeman police 
about doing patrols in the area to dis
courage loitering of nonresidents in 
the complex on weekends a common 

complaint from residents green said 
that while they would like to see the 
projects finished quickly we are kind 
of at the mercy of our subcontractors
matthew bussey a political science 
major from washington moved into 

stadium view when they opened a few 
days before classes started on aug 24 
bussey was one of many students who 
responded to advertisements last year 

promising luxury accommodations 
and a communal 
student living 
atmosphere at the 
offcampus com
plex after seeing 
pictures and 

descriptions of 
luxury accommo
dations at other 
sites around the 
country bussey 
agreed to shar
ing an apartment 
with another 
friend and room
mates but now 

bussey said hes 
disappointed 
by construction 
delays that have 

left many of the 
promised luxury 
accommoda
tions unfinished 

and inaccessible 
overall he said he feels like the com
pany overpromised on what it would 

actually be able to deliver residents 
upon move in
bussey said that although he is 
unhappy with some aspects of living 
at stadium view 
he does not place 
blame on the 
management who 

he believes are 
making the most 

of a bad situation 
this sentiment 

was echoed in 
part by green 
while green ac
knowledged some 
of the problems 

with the construc
tion and behavior 
of tenants she 
said they are do
ing their best to 

address the issues   
green admitted 
the timetable at 

the beginning of 
the school year 
was hurried but 
stated that sta
dium view wanted to focus on getting 
people moved in so they would have 

places to live first and then work on 
the other promised parts of the com
plex green stated that only one build
ings residents were forced to move in 

later than their lease promised and 
those who couldnt move in when 

school started were provided alternate 
housing or reimbursed for rent for the 
delays students who had issues with 
their apartments were given visa gift 
cards for their inconvenience green 

pointed to several common areas of 
the complex that have already been 
completed and are open for resident 
use such as the gaming rooms and a 
gym
while stadium view is one of the 
most recent housing projects students 

have complained of it is far from the 

first between students complaining of 

unfair charges and fees from landlords 
a city struggling to keep up with the 
growth of the university coupled with 

a construction worker shortage the 

situation is likely to continue for the 
foreseeable future

onto freshmen students at any school 
a resident advisor ra is the 
most important resource they have 
an ra is a role model a mentor and 
a great influence on all of the incom
ing freshmen who live in the 
dorms likely away from home 

for the first times in their 
lives freshmen appreciate 
this when talking to ras they 

say that most of their residents 

have shown gratitude for what 
they do as ras however the 
way the university and reslife 

show their appreciation is less 

than stellar 
ras at msu are given free room and 
board as compensation for their work 

that is not bad until one considers 
that ras are not allowed to have a job 
on the side even if they do have time 
a reslife ra who chose to remain 
anonymous to protect their job told 

me reslife expects us to pay for our 

own soaps toothpaste and any sort of 
basic necessity like that this ra felt 
that since they have about as much time 

to work on the side as a student athlete 
would they should have these basic 
expenses covered 
i also talked to an ra at occidental 
college in los angeles where ras 
are given a stipend on top of their free 
room and board both of these ras 

believed that it is critical that ras get 

compensated in a tangible way they 
also agreed that while the job is incred
ibly rewarding and they have had more 
opportunities to help others then ever 

before the physical and mental toll put 
on them was not being taken seriously 
enough by the organization that em
ploys them  the university 
the life of an ra becomes dominat
ed by school and the various responsi

bilities associated with taking care of 

a floor full of people for many ras 

this leads to physical neglect of the 
self the msu ra told me the physi
cal costs are often associated with less 

sleep and that for me personally i 
eat less because i spend my mornings on 
homework instead of eating due to ra 
duties 
the occidental ra had 
similar sentiments there is a 

huge push in the ra commu
nity for selfcare which is so 

important and every ra can 
preach can preach that self
care is important but i simply 

do not have time for selfcare 

if i am to complete all of my 
homework and on top of that she 

said i personally believe that i have 

gotten physically sick from the stress 
of being an ra i get significantly less 
sleep since when i am on duty i have 
to answer all calls all through the night 
and each call can take hours on end
as physically and mentally taxing as 
the job is being an ra is an incredibly 
rewarding experience and is of course 
not about money but they are not vol
unteers working for a nonprofit they 
are employees of the school they are 
fulfilling roles that the school could not 

function without such as acting as the 

main resource for freshmen students to 
get adjusted to living in a college envi
ronment they maintain the order and 

safety of thousands of students living 

on campus and provide the university 
with a great deal of protection when 
they do their jobs correctly the dorms 

would be madhouses without ras 

monitoring them the school realizes 
this and does to an extent compensate 
them with room and board but here at 

msu that is all they get it is as if the 

school is saying thanks for all your 
hard work you can stay with us for a 
little less money it is too bad you arent 

allowed to work a job on the side to be 

able to pay for shampoo
resident advisors ras are tasked with   
  some of the most distasteful tasks on 
campus dealing with overly drunk fresh
men trying to persuade the less social that 
mingling with others is not directly linked 
to death organizing the cleanup 
of the physical and foulsmelling 
remnants of dorm tenants friday 
nights etc it makes sense that 
they receive free room and board 
as compensation what com
plicates the situation is whether 
they should be paid in addition 
to that or not when thousands 
of college students take out loans 
to pay for housing and tuition 
ras dont have to worry about those funds 
because their housing and tuition is free 
ras receive a room and board plan worth 
at least 5081 per semester depending on 
housing location it is commonly estimated 
that an ra dedicates approximately 20 to 30 
hours each week to ra duties is means 

that an ra earns about 317 each week of 
the semester with average hourly pay rang
ing between 1016 is combined with 

the convenience of working from home 
living on campus and not having to prepare 
meals makes being an ra an excellent job 
option ey dont pay for room and board 
in exchange for their jobs as ras e uni
versity could pay ras the equivalent value of 
their food and lodging for the year but that 
money earned would just go to paying those 

exact same bills 
its not as though this lack direct mon
etary exchange has been an issue in the 
ra selection process e reslife sta has 
hundreds of applicants for the ra posi
tions on campus annually ere wouldnt 
be nearly as many people interested if 
being an ra wasnt worth the compensa
tion e large applicant pool gives the 

university the discretion to choose who 
they see t to be ras without compromis
ing the quality of ras on campus meaning 
that the university doesnt stand to benet 

from investing more funds into reslife 
ose interested in helping the incoming 
residents of the residence halls are carefully 

trained and the cream of the crop is even
tually selected
e primary conict with being an ra 
is the amount of hours com
mitted being an ra requires 
being available to the students 
physically and emotionally 

whenever they need help at 

can be an extremely taxing posi
tion rather than paying ras 
in addition to the money spent 

providing for their lodging 

perhaps the university could 
look into programs similar to 
those for athletes who receive scholarships 
that supplement the extra costs associated 

with college athletes also have two jobs 
education and sports ey dedicate hours 
to physical tness and bobcat athletics 

has helped alleviate the stress of school 

by providing an academic help center 
specically for athletes in the case of ras 
the school should be paying for tutoring 

so as not to jeopardize the education of 

the ras activities in the sub should be 
discounted so ras have a positive outlet 
that is conveniently close
e monetary aspect of the job has 
already been taken care of any additional 

funds should be allocated to improving 
the eciency of the program in order to 
minimize the negative eects the job may 
have on the educations of ras stress 
management classes or an ra study center 

would be conducive to promoting the 

wellbeing of the ras better resources for 

ras not direct monetary reimbursements 
would be more benecial in the long term 
for ras students and the university ras 

will have more opportunities to solidify 

their intellectual and emotional stability 
which will help them do their job more 
eectively thereby beneting the students 

e university will be devoting funds that 
will directly improve life on campus and 
keep university money on campus

high time to end high times the pros and cons of 
drug testing for students receiving financial aid
though college oers the opportunity 
for educational growth students oen 
regard their college years as a time for explora
tion of independence and ex
perimentation for many students 

msu is their last stop in enjoying 

minimal stress before becoming 

overwhelmed by the responsibility 

of adulthood however the enjoy
ment of college life generally comes 

with moral and nancial price tags 

as students oen test the boundaries 

of society and life through underage 

drinking and illegal drug use stu
dents have a right to experience life and the 

risks associated with their choices yet while 

i support students indulging in their new 

found freedom it should not come at the cost 

of taxpayers ultimately a student who nds 

these illegal activities along with potential 

nancial penalties aordable should nd the 

costs of higher education similarly aordable 

why then are student funds not spent on 

tuition instead
over 80 percent of students enrolled in 
public universities are receiving federal nan
cial aid e largest component of federal aid 

is the pell grant which can provide sums of 

up to 5775 per undergraduate student e 

pell grant program is federally funded and 

does not need to be repaid is is a lot of 
money wasted considering over half of msus 

students fail to graduate or drop out shortly 

aer enrollment according to the journal 
of studies on alcohol and drugs 

there is a signicant association 

between illicit drug use and discon
tinuous enrollment ese dropouts 

are squandering taxbacked funds 

as a society it has been determined 

that nancial assistance should be 

granted to the student populace in 

order to better societal outcomes by 

improving its standards with higher 

educated individuals taxpayers do 
not get what they pay for when the federally 

aided student fails to graduate ose most 

at fault are the stereotypical party students 

whose collegiate pastimes are nanced by 

taxpayers around 40 percent of american 

college students have been or are currently 

using illicit drugs and about 80 percent drink 

alcohol no percentage of federal funds 

should support illicit drug use or any facet of 

the party life how though can we eectively 

cut federal aid for reckless students while 

maintaining aid for responsible students one 

solution is to identify the reckless students 

through drug testing
students must meet certain requirements 
to be eligible for federal nancial aid one 

of the requirements should include being 
drug free i believe the party years of students 

should be funded by the party students them
selves and not taxpayers if a student identies 

partying underage drinking and illicit drug 

use as aordable priorities in their life they 

should put in the eort to be selfsustaining 

by nding employment furthermore if these 

partygoers prioritize their recreations over 

education they should pay their higher edu
cation bills out of their own pockets and not 

those of the taxpayer 84 percent of employers 

drug test potential employees prior to hiring 

them is means the majority of federal aid 

is funded by individuals who had to pass drug 

tests in order to earn the very wages that are 

taxed when drug tests are required for the 

workforce to earn wages drug tests should 

be required for the students to benet from 

the earnings of that workforce in addition 

to ensuring taxfunded programs do not end 

up putting money in the pockets of drug 

dealers drug testing can prevent addicts and 

even dealers from attending in the rst place 

is has the potential to positively impact the 

university as a whole
one of the obstacles present in establishing 
a campuswide drug testing program is the 

cost e average drug test costs around 30 

per person ough testing could be provided 

through university health services at no cost 

to the student the cost to the university or 
government of recurring tests could be higher 

than what the outcome is worth e state of 

oklahoma recently spent roughly 386000 

to drug test 3342 welfare applicants to nd 

that only 297 tested positive for drug use 

furthermore students may nd drug testing 

to be an invasion of individual privacy how
ever failure to pass a drug test does not herald 

public scrutiny and therefore does not make 

students private lives public
in place of recurring drug tests what i be
lieve would be a viable option is the implemen
tation of a single drug test upon applying for 

federal aid in the same manner that the aver
age laborer would submit to a drug test in the 

initial stages of becoming employed so would 

a student of msu requesting federal student 

aid submit to a drug test through the univer
sitys health services and just as an applicant 

would lose their employment opportunities 

with a positive drug test if a student failed to 

provide clean results they would lose their op
portunity for federal aid students should be 

provided the same opportunities presented to 

the labor force college is a window that pro
vides a glimpse of the professional world that 

will envelop its graduates as the majority of 

employers require preemployment drug tests 

so should universities require an initial drug 

test prior to the disbursement of federal aid 

aer all we strive to be a society of equality

club sports on campus
fresh faces fresh start for 
msu bobcat hockey
the sticks are taped and the 
skates are sharpened as the young 
montana state team hits the ice this 

fall the team is going to face a lot 

of challenges this season as they 

are comprised mostly of freshman 

and have a lot of learning to do 

former player and now coach for the 

bobcats corey jewell takes over the 

reins this season
in his first year he is looking 
to keep things simple as they move 

forward we need to work on our 

systems entry and exit into zones 

and covering man on man defense 

he said as a former player on this 

team he has a 

unique perspective 

of how to approach 

each and every game 
with roughly 
twothirds of 

the team being 

freshmen the 

club looks to gain 

valuable experience 

as the season 

which began oct 

9 continues jewel 

is matching the 

team speed with 

physical play to 

overpower opponents as the team 

goes through some growing pains 

they will depend on goalie phillip 

lowther a junior to get them 

through some rough patches a 

butterfly style goalie he possesses 

lightning fast reflexes that keep 
the cats in contention nightin and 

nightout
the bobcat hockey team plays 
at the haynes pavilion at the 

fairgrounds in bozeman the ice 

rink has metal bleachers around the 

rink where fans can get upclose 

and personal with the game with 

consistent attendance there are 

typically no seats available at the 

games if no seats are available then 

there is plenty of standing room 

all around the rink right next to 

the boards more of a barn than a 

hockey rink the stadium can get loud 

fast with screaming fans banging 
their hands against 

the boards roaring 

after each heat the 

atmosphere makes 

the games fun for 

even the most novice 

of fans
the rink opened 
on monday sept 

28 and the bobcats 

had tryouts that day 

and again on the 

following wednesday 

after the team was 

narrowed down they 

had two practices 
before their first game on friday 

oct 9 against the bozeman stingers 

the stingers are a senior a team 

full of former bobcats the game 

was a dogfight with the first period 

being used to get acquainted to the 

ice again after the first period 
the teams were tied at one apiece 

and going into the second period you 

could tell each team had made some 

adjustments in order to create more 

offense with newfound legs the teams 

started to get physical with plenty of 

hits and penalties to go with it nearing 

the end of the third it looked like the 

game would go into overtime however 

due to a bad shift change chase 

dagostino of the stingers scored on 
a breakaway with three seconds left to 

win the game 54 stingers
 the bobcats hope to learn from 
this contest and use the experience 

to build toward success when they 

travel to utah to face brigham 

young university this weekend the 

bobcats next home game will be nov 

6 against utah state university and 

then another on nov 7 against the 

university of wyoming both at 7 pm 
i know how quickly 
things can get 
negative i have 
to keep it positive 
through the entire 
season using his 
previous experience 
jewell hopes to 
apply his awareness 
of the game to 
ensure players are in 
the correct position
when people talk about bobcat athletics they usually 
have varsity sports in mind such as football volleyball 
or the ski team but on campus there are well over 400 

club athletes that arent varsity athletes club sports allow 

students to participate in a wide variety of activities at many 

different levels of competition these sports range from 
lacrosse to logging from polo to rugby offering something 
for everyone club sports are a great way to get active and 

involved
took fourth last year raymond con
tinued its pretty cool weve got a lot 
of new girls this year catapalooza has 

been a great use of our recruiting time 
the team hasnt yet had a chance 
to see the new members in real action 

aside from a couple scrimmages against 

the mens team here on campus the 

team will travel to missoula for the 
big sky gunshow 

tournament
its the first 
big tournament that 

everyone goes to from 

our section raymond 

explained its great 

its early in the year 

its nice out and you 

get to see all the new 

girls you start real
izing whos the tough 

one whos the one to 

beat we did pretty 

well last year at this 

event  third  and 
im looking forward to seeing the new 

girls compete
look for the team to continue to 
improve as the new women get their feet 

underneath them raymond concluded 

theres not a huge ultimate presence 

in montana and thats something were 

trying to change especially on the 

womens side in montana we wanted to 

fix that and now here we are
only recently recognized as a top 
level sport by the international olympic 

committee ultimate frisbee began 

during the 1950s and became especially 

popular on college campuses the sport 

 an odd combination of football 

soccer and frisbee  involves passing a 

disc down the field into the endzone to 

score points without running with the 

frisbee 
here at montana 
state the ultimate clubs 

have been around for 

a while however just 

last year the womens 

ultimate frisbee club 

gained recognition as 

an official club sport on 

campus as an official 

club sport the team can 

now compete and rep
resent montana state at 

meets and competitions 
the team practices 
three times a week 

to improve their skills right now 

we probably have around 30 girls in 

the club at practice we have about 

15 regularly said club president lily 

raymond who is entering her second 

year with the club last year when we 

started i was one of the new girls we 

lose some girls over the winter when 

we practice in the gym but we still did 

pretty well at sectionals  i think we 
when one thinks of club sports 
one typically doesnt think of the 

sport founded in fantasy world 

of witches and wizards the msu 

quidditch team  founded in 2014  

gets students out and running about 

in a harry potteresque fashion 
the rules to the game are adapted 
from the bestselling harry potter 

novels by jk rowling quidditch 

is a coed contact sport with seven 

players on the field each player 

plays with a broom between their 

legs usually made from a pvc pipe 

three chasers score goals with vol
leyballs called quaffles the quaffle 

can be advanced by passing kicking 

or running with it and goals scored 

are worth 10 points each a keeper 

tries to defend the goals while two 

beaters use dodge balls called 

bludgers to disrupt the flow of the 

offense each team also has a seeker 

and is responsible for the capturing 

of the snitch the snitch is a yellow 

ball attached to the waistband of  a 

yellowdressed neutral player who 

attempts to avoid capture the snitch 

is worth 30 points and the game ends 
with the capture of the snitch
the msu quidditch team for
mally known as the big sky flyers 

is in its second year and is growing 

rapidly the team debuted their 

second season with a trip to canada 

where they played four games losing 

them all against wellestablished 

canadian teams 
on oct 10 the team travelled to 
utah to compete against the crimson 

elite utah states club team and 

boise state thestrals club teams 

although they lost both games by 

decent margins the team has confi
dence for their future 
since we are new we are defi
nitely the underdogs in the region 

player hannah johnston said 

director for the northwest region 

kym couch told us our team shows a 

lot of potential 
quidditch uses its unique environ
ment to bring together athletes and 

harry potter fans alike its a warm 

welcoming environment executive 

board member tasha lynn said  as 

soon as we hit the pitch we are all one 

big family 
you start realizing 
whos the tough 
one whos the one 
to beat we did 
pretty well last 
year at this event 
 third  and im 
looking forward to 
seeing the new girls 
compete

e montana state university 
bobcats had a lot of doubters over 
the past week aer a forgettable 

performance against northern 

arizona the weekend prior the fans 

and boosters seemed upset and for 

the second time this young season 

the cats backs were against the 

wall a loss to what was an inferior 

sacramento state team by most 

accounts  especially at home  

would likely put the bobcats on 

the outside of the playo picture 

montana state responded to the 

pressure with a 3513 victory on 

saturday
e cats as they oen do at 
home got o to a fast start against 

the hornets not more than one 

minute into the rst quarter junior 

dakota prukop hit sophomore 

mitchell herbert on a short check 

down pass and herbert did the rest 

outrunning the hornet defenders 

for the 79yard touchdown and 

an early lead e muchdiscussed 

bobcat defense did much better 

this week limiting the hornets 

 although drops and missed 

assignments could also be culprits 

 to threeandouts on multiple 

occasions including their rst drive 

of the game allowing the bobcats 

to sprint to a 140 lead aer just ve 

minutes of play 
but almost inexplicably things 
started to shi in the hornets 

direction e oense completely 

stalled out punting on four straight 

drives including three threeand
outs and the defense began to 
revert giving up chunks of yardage 
to both the run and the pass for
tunately for msu sac state missed 

a eld goal and settled for a short 
one missing their opportunities 
to take control of the game e 

bobcat oense going for a fourth

andtwo at mideld sprung junior 

gunnar brekke loose on a big play 

that led to a touchdown a couple 
plays aer giving the cats a 2110 
lead at the half 
it was mostly a lack of ex
ecution mainly in the backeld 

prukop said of the slump he gave 

credit to the defense for keeping 
the oense loose we had time to 
gure things out when our defense 
was getting stops it keeps us out 
of that situation when you feel like 

you have to score every drive every 

play
e third quarter started o as 
a snoozefest with both oenses 

looking unable to execute and plen
ty of missed passes by the quarter
backs e hornets added another 

chipshot red zone eld goal to cut 
the lead to eight points midway 
through the third quarter but lost 

their starting quarterback to an 
injury and were able to execute 
their downeld attacks to the same 
degree especially in the crowded 
red zone e bobcat oense man
aged to get rolling with a couple big 

plays and one  possibly their best 

of the season  methodical and 

long scoring drive to put the game 

out of sac states reach at 3513  
maybe we just need to play 
every game at home msu head 

coach rob ash joked aer the win 
it takes a little pressure o the of
fense knowing we know that if we 

stall out for a minute the defense 

will have our backs and maybe we 

can be a more conventional football 

team from this point forward
prukop passed for 277 yards on 
12 of 22 passing and rushed for 69 

yards junior chad newell rushed 

for 68 and brekke rushed for 61 
e cats outgained the hornets in 
total yardage 511 to 385
with a mustwin home victory 
locked away the cats will have to 

turn their attention to a resurgent 
portland state program for next 
week e vikings have dominated 

all season and fresh o a 667 vic

tory over fbs north texas the bob
cats hit the road facing a highstakes 

road game montana state played 

a decent game this week but must 

continue to take major steps forward 
on both sides of the ball if the want 
to prevent yet another road loss and 

be dropped to a dark horse in the 

big sky conference race e cats 
and the vikings will kick o from

outdoor
show to identify the ve types of sprayers
by 
parker
 webb
odds are if you have ever done any
thing in the outdoors youve probably 
sprayed as defined loosely by outdoor 
enthusiasts everywhere spraying is a 
conversation about an outdoor activity 

in which the ego enters causing the dis
cussion to become full blown bragging 
and an expression of exaggerated radness 

its hard not to spray if you are excited 
about a recent climb ski ride or what
ever you want to talk about it how
ever there is a fine line between stoked 

conversation about said outdoor activi
ties and excessive spraying if you hang 

out with outdoor people chances are 
you will get sucked into a spray session 
at some point or another these sessions 

can be no big deal or merit an immedi
ate and swift departure from the sprayer 
depending on the type you are talking to 

luckily these egoboosting people can 
be broken down into five main types
 type 1 the accidental sprayer
 the accidental sprayer is a harmless 
calm being in fact the accidental sprayer 
can be and probably is a friend of yours 
this creature sprays through storytelling 
while explaining a recent trip the acci

dental sprayer will describe an epic event 
however it will begin to get out of 
hand and an expression of radness will 

be dropped examples include there 
we were at the base of the grand teton 
wall street was iced up but we climbed 
it anyways it was totally epic man 
made me feel like a hero almost every
one has been at one time or another an 
accidental sprayer its all good theres no 
problem with that we all need to inflate 

our egos every now and then
 type 2 the instasprayer
 living in todays ever connected 
society its almost impossible to not be 

connected to the social medias the in
stasprayer does just that they instagram 

their cool outdoor activities throwing 

hashtags left and right while instamy
facetwittergramming the instasprayer 

spends more time hashtagging than 

skiing or climbing if asked they always 
will know how many followers they 
have and what the best filter to use is 

luckily like the accidental sprayer the 
instasprayer is generally benign dont 
follow them too closely on the face
book though or you may become one 
of them
 type 3 the dropper
 type 3 is where we get into true 
sprayers a conversation with a type 3 
sprayer or higher dictates caution and 
care tread carefully or you may be 

stuck in a conversation lasting hours and 

leaving you with a lessened self esteem 
the dropper is all about dropping 
things name dropping grade dropping 

 if it can be dropped in a conversa
tion theyll drop it when talking about 

professional kayakers skiers or climbers 

they use first names only as if they knew 
the person if you ask them about their 
weekend they say things like it was 

totally sick bro first i climbed my first 
511b trad route where i ran into con
rad then i kayaked a class v rapid and 
hucked a gnarly 50footer on a double 
black up at the yellowstone club more 
references will be mentioned than a 

scientific journal take care outdoor 
enthusiast talking to a dropper can send 
you into a whirl of cynicism and doubt 
questioning your pursuit of the outdoor 

lifestyle
 type 4 the 
outdoer repeated interactions with an 
outdoer will almost certainly cause 
your personality to shift to outrage and 
aggression never ever try to mildly ex
plain the ride you did over the weekend 
you might casually say it was a fun ride 
nothing too exciting no big deal the 

outdoer with his aggressive and egotis
tical attitude with respond with a state
ment about how much more extreme 
his weekend was he wont comment on 
how its awesome you got out biking or 
what a fun trail that is no the outdo

er will come in with a full blown attack 
of exaggerations and hyperboles leaving 
everyone questioning his motives and 

whether he truly actually did what he 
said or not while dangerous to interact 
with witnessing a sprayoff between two 
outdoers is a fun sight for all enjoy 

from a distance
 type 5 the spraysaurus rex
 take extreme caution to avoid the 
sprayasaurus rex i cannot recommend an 
interaction with one on any terms there 
will be no small talk when talking to this 

sprayer type they will go directly into 
spray releasing spray with so much inten
sity it will have you needing a towel after 
talking to them winded conversations 
primarily onesided will have you reach
ing for your phone to fake a phone call 
all subsequent spray groups are made 
up within this ferocious sprayer due to 
their hostile and egotistical nature the 

sprayasaurus rex is very territorial one 
can be found at every climbing gym 
anywhere the best plan of action if one 

is spotted is to run besides who wants 
to climb indoors anyways

its steep to boot i watch as my two partners 

gallivant ahead of me seemingly unfazed by 

our precarious situation pushing my hesita
tion to the back of my mind i continue to 

clamber through the endless sea of scree until 

i can make out the top of the slope above me 

my partners disappear up and over the nal 

rise into the sunshine and i follow suit as i 

come up and over the last hurdle to gain the 

ridge im stunned by what i see stretching 

before me was the west ridge of crazy peak 

and from our vantage point it looked impen
etrable it was a 1000 foot vertical knife edge 

serrated with jagged rock spires that clawed at 

the sky now i was most denitely out of my 

element at that moment i doubted whether 

i was capable of attaining the summit and as 

we began to make our way along the ridge i 

was petried what the hell was i doing here
e crazy mountains are an oen 
overlooked mountain range in southwest 

montana some would describe them as out 
of place as there is no discernable reason as 

to why they should be where they are ey 

stand alone as sentinels over the prairie a 

cluster of big peaks with big vertical reliefs to 

match e tallest peak in the range is crazy 

peak which tops out at a respectable 11209 

feet making it the tallest mountain in mon
tana north of the beartooths it was the peak 

we planned on bagging that weekend 
i got my rst good look at the crazies on 
the drive to the big timber trailhead having 

never been into the crazies before i was sur
prised by their prominence ey were much 

bigger than i anticipated and towered over the 

surrounding landscape crazy peak has close to 

5000 feet of vertical relief above its immediate 

surroundings and close to 7000 feet of relief 

above the nearby yellowstone river valley it 

loomed above us as we started to hike beckon
ing us into the heart of the crazies
we camped near blue and granite lakes 
that night planning an assault on the west 

ridge come morning ere werent any de
ned trails past our campsite e trails end
ed at blue and granite lakes but the route 

to the summit seemed simple enough all we 

had to do was gain the west ridge and then 

follow that to the top as it turned out this 
was easier said than done e next morning 

we found ourselves at the base of a large scree 

slope that stood between us and the west 

ridge it was precipitous and riddled with 

small gullies that ran like ngers down its gut 

we gingerly started to climb up through one 

of the chutes as it provided moderately more 

stability than the rest of the scree slope it was 

a meticulous and slow ascent i was pleased 

to reach the top of the slope until i saw what 

was yet to come
my ambition buckled when i rst saw the 
ridge to the summit it was narrow and sheer 

and dropped several thousand feet down 

either side it was peppered with sharp rock 

pinnacles throughout the middle section a 

fall here would not be an option i walked 

over to my two partners what do you guys 

think i asked
looks pretty puckered my friend observed 
lets just start climbing and see what happens 
i reluctantly agreed to keep moving i 
was well outside my comfort zone and the 

magnitude of the situation weighed me down 

with every step e rst section was the worst 

it narrowed down to practically nothing at 

times forcing us to skirt beneath the ridge 

next came the notches which were woeful 
and windy ere was nothing to hold onto 

that wasnt scree is fact was complicated 

by the incessant wind that ripped through 

the notches and threatened to blow us o the 

mountain i looked down at crazy lake a 

thousand feet below me i was gripped
e ridge mellowed out aer the notches 
it was now a straight shot to the summit 

we quickened the pace and cruised the 

remaining distance until we reached the false 

summit of crazy e true summit was just a 

stones throw away but resided on the other 

side of a large notch i think i was the rst 

to realize that we would go no further e 

summit was tantalizingly close and yet un
obtainable to reach it would require down 

climbing a narrow couloir into the notch and 

somehow nding a way up the other side it 

didnt look promising we continued to scout 

for a safe way through and came up empty 

handed i sat down and stared at the summit 

it taunted me i wanted it badly but i was 

forced to accept that this was the end of the 

line e risks were simply too great to justify 

continuing further so with a granola bar 

in one hand and a dented ego in the other i 

turned my back on the summit and headed 

home

 comedy troupe  stargazing  marching bands choreographer  the new miller
honors musicale celebrates democracy of music
by keegan grady
in the leigh lounge last friday oct 9 
connor padden sat resplendent in a black 
kilt and irish driving cap he sat down 

and smiled thinking about the melody of 
the song he was about to play plucking a 
few quiet notes he drew the bow across 
the strings of his violin filling the room 
with a resonant hum he closed his eyes 

and with no more ado the silence was 
broken by the lilting melody of an irish 
jig
e honors musicale is a littleknown 
tradition at montana state it has been in 

existence since 2009 when dr ilsemari 
lee became director of the honors college 
beginning in the basement of 
quad d it 
grew quickly in performers and audience 
and migrated to 
quad f and then to the 
leigh lounge in its current incarnation 
it happens four times a year  the recent 
concert one on dec 4 and two more in the 

spring e musicale is by no means an hon
orsspecic event lee stressed all students 

faculty and sta at msu are welcome
musicale is a strange term for us today 
 according to merriam webster it is a 

party or social aair featuring a musical 
program and indeed the atmosphere of 
msus musicale felt more like a party than 

a fancydress event e performers sat on 
a piano bench in the center of the room 
and the audience was on couches spread 
in a semicircle it didnt feel like a concert 
as much as a royal court entertainment 

some performances were not always even 
prepared  some people only performed 
aer the audience called for them to do 
so cajoled and harassed by their friends 
the players would reluctantly walk up and 

blow the audience away with a gorgeous 

piece of art e relaxed atmosphere was an 

important part of that creative energy we 
are a supportive and appreciative audience 
lee explained to receive the thunderous 

applause of their peers creates a moment 

that will encourage and inspire young 
musicians for years to come
spontaneous music oen has very little 
outlet in our society busking requires time 
and permits and playing music late at night 
disturbs the peace however many of the 
music worlds greatest stars began their 

careers in impromptu settings  jazz clubs 

dive bars street corners and back alleyways 
amateur music sometimes suers from 
an overdose of perfectionism in american 

mindsets however msu is certainly not 

opposed to public music we can always 

create more opportunities lee said lunch 
hour concerts in the sub and future per
formances spaces in the norm asbjornson 
innovation center are all spaces where we 
can celebrate and foster music and creativity 
at msu she also mused on the prospect of 

sunday gatherings in residence halls and 

later she added we need more ash mobs
while most students might not be wild 
on the idea of joining a flash mob no 

one can rule out the joy of performing 

or being an audience member boze
man has a thriving music scene  from 
kelly robertis jazz to drink me plentys 
hard folk our town is wellstocked with 

fantastic musicians to take advantage of 

that start here at msu if you play an in
strument sing or would like to do either 

think about joining the next musicale as 

lee said we need players and audiences 

help us foster the creative and perform
ing arts in our community all it takes 
is a first step reaching out and getting 
engaged in the community
as the evening faded the leigh lounge 
was still filled with music choirs arme
nian piano pieces guitar duets french 
and german vocal pieces ukulele and 
an irish fiddle carried out into the street 

from the lounges open windows the 

audience clapped cheered and occasion
ally stomped their approval friedrich 

nietzsche once said without music 

life would be a mistake as the last notes 

died no one in the room was feeling the 

least bit mistaken

every once in awhile you nd a 
store that is truly unique  from 
the moment you step inside you 
instinctively know it cactus 
records is one of those places 

entering cactus gives the distinct 

impression of a space that has been 

carefully curated and craed to 

create a memorable experience 

every square 

inch is covered in 

colorful bits of 

musical memora
bilia patchwork 

squares of vinyl 

records or gener
ally unique prod
ucts that serve 

to illustrate the 
atmosphere of 
the shop cactus 
has had a long 
time to develop this atmosphere 

during its 45 years in bozeman 

and since has become a landmark 

of the town to many
although founded in 1970 
the shop was taken over by mike 

bueno good 14 years ago bueno 

bought cactus from the former 

owners aer they retired he says 

that the store remained mostly the 

same aer he took over with one 

large exception being the amount 

of vinyl records today the shop 

oers hundreds of vinyls but when 
he took over they maybe had one 
or two records said bueno his 
previous job was in vinyl distri
bution for a record label in san 

francisco so when he started at 

cactus it was only natural to intro
duce more vinyl im not a huge 

audiophile he says its more of a 

collecting thing for me he enjoys 

the beauty of a welldesigned ep 

and loves collecting records both 

new and old
but cactus records is not only 
a haven for music lovers it also 
stocks a huge range of strangely 
wonderful little knickknacks as 

well as a variety of locally designed 
or craed products such as tshirts 
and jewelry one section of the 

shop is devoted to body piercings 
while another corner consists of 
shelves stacked high with incense 

is is part of what makes the store 

so memorable  it has a character 

that just cant be pinned down its 

the kind of place id like to go and 
its an expression 

of our past and 

every employee 

that has ever 

worked there 

bueno said add
ing that everyone 
who works at 
the shop brings 
something dier
ent and everyone 
has a certain part 
of the store that 
reects them in a way cactus will 
never stay quite the same it will 

always be in some amount of ux 

as time goes on most recently 

the shop has just started carrying 

comic books
e basement area has become 
lled with comic books old and 

new aer bueno bought a collec

tion of nearly 7000 he also says 

that there are two employees of the 

store who are the biggest comic 

book nerds ever and have been 

pricing and organizing the collec
tion another big addition to the 
shop was the introduction of online 
ticket sales to local shows cactus 
website has seen a big spike in traf

c over the last two or three years 

when it became a ticketing resource 

for local events and of course all 

of these tickets can be purchased 

instore as well but sometimes you 

dont even have to leave cactus 

to see live performances as part 

of their ongoing eort to support 

local music they occasionally host 

live shows instore and if you 
miss those you can always browse 
the permanent collection of local 
music that the shop carries is 
along with the local goods they 
carry show it is clear they strive to 

maintain a tight connection with 
bozeman no matter what
is is what makes cactus re
cords the store it is today it doesnt 
attempt to constrain itself to any 

one thing like bozeman itself the 

shop is composed of a multitude 
of diverse interests and colorful 
people as bueno remarks we just 

want to be a reection of bozeman 
as a whole he dislikes sterile 
environments and homogenized 

culture in general at is why a 
visit to cactus records is always 
a worthy trip to experience it 
personally in all of its wonderful 
nonhomogenized goodness every 

bozemanite should go to cactus at 

least once and while youre there 
be sure to give the store mascot 
bacon bit an enormous dog a 

belly rub she loves that

time to fall into a glass of wine
autumn is one of my favorite times to 
drink wine aside from the rest of the year 
while chilled whites and temperate reds are 

always in season the varying temps of fall 

make both particularly appropriate dayby
day grab a glass and let me tell you how to 
make the very most of the coming weeks
midterms are coming you can tell 
because everybody looks like they got into 

a headbutting ght with a truck e lack 
of sleep and dangerous doses of caeine 
rushing through your body are destroying 

you your future looks bleak and theres not 

enough makeup in the world to cover up 

the wrinkles you now have from keeping 
your eyes open by liing your eyebrows 
but i come bearing excellent news wine is 

healthy no really multiple studies have 

suggested that having 12 drinks of any 
alcohol a day can decrease the risk of heart 
disease stroke diabetes metabolic syn
drome and early death but wine speci
cally has been shown to decrease mortality 
considerably in winedrinkers over beer and 

hard liquor drinkers and the tannins in red 

wines protect against heart disease more
over a columbia university study showed 
that brain function declined at a slower rate 
in moderate drinkers than teetotalers
now that weve established some good 
reasons to have a pour lets gure out what 

were putting in that big glass of health
e typically crisp and cool nights of 
october classically lend themselves to 

robust red wines try a rhnestyle blend 
or grenache is varietal traces its origin 
to southern france where it was blended to 

create the now iconic chteauneuf du pape 

grenache is now the second most ubiqui
tous grape in the world so its not hard to 
nd in the store typically presenting with 

mild fruit and spice its not too intense in 

case you typically nd the inyourface na
ture of reds to be oputting e grenache

containing rhnestyle blends tend to be 
even more tame
syrah is another good option is grape 
grows all over the place and is almost invari
ably bottled with the avors of dark cherry 

leather and earth ive even known a syrah 
to taste like fallen leaves smell  in a good 

way try pairing it with soup to stay extra 

warm
for something particularly intense and 
interesting elect for a zinfandel from 

californias central valley or coast ese 

arent for pairing with a meal they are the 

meal a good zin will be intensely jammy 
with strawberry plum and zesty pepper its 
exactly what you want to ease away the pain 

of a long cold day of dealing with other 

human beings
however if youre cozying up next to 
the radiator to watch some netix and you 

want a wine with a little less bite look for a 

pinot noir from the sonoma coast or rus

sian river valley eyre usually smooth 
supple and overrun with ripe berry  oh so 
drinkable
if reds arent your proverbial cup of tea 
rest assured that there are some whites to 

t the fall bill chardonnay comes in two 

varieties oaked and unoaked an oaked 

chardonnay  one that has been aged in 

oak barrels  serves savory realness full of 
rich butter and earthy bread an unoaked 
chardonnay is aged in steel instead and is 

more fruitforward with green apple and 

fresh cedar for a sweet nightender pour 

yourself a glass of riesling which spans the 
gap between regular wine and dessert wine 
presenting lots of stone fruit to bring you 

back to warmer days serve these lighter 
varietals chilled
lets not forget our more energetically
corked friends as always sparkling wine 
is appropriate in autumn winter spring 
summer weekends weekdays evenings 
aernoons and mornings relieve the pres

sure in your head by releasing the pressure 

from a bottle 
but i want something cold with the 
more intense structure of a red i hear 
you say well you can have the best of 
both wines in this world meet ros the 

superior to roseb ros just happens to be 
my favorite style of wine and is an absolute 
imperative for the warmer days of autumn 
like weve been having lately its served 
chilled like a white is smoother and more 

drinkable like a white but has structure 

and body more akin to a red ey sit in 

the very very happy medium that can 

bring you back to summer and prime you 
for winter ross come in a number of 

tints and in general a darker ros will have 
more tannin and red wine character than a 
lighter ros so grab a bottle you can nd 

them anywhere and cool o with a glass 

outside this weekend soaking up the nal 

moments of warmth as the sun sets on this 

fabulous fall cheers

pain and pleasure in metal gear 
solid v e phantom pain
by will hamel
how does a video game series as long memo
rable frustrating and legendary as metal gear 
solid come to a close with a game thats long 

memorable frustrating and for more reasons 

than one legendary
metal gear solid 5 e phantom pain is 
the supposed conclusion to the metal gear 

franchise which began in 1987 e franchise 

reached major popularity in 1998 when its 

ps1 release metal gear solid redened how 

video games were experienced instead of merely 

testing your dexterity and problemsolving skills 

metal gear solid delivered a rich cinematic 

and gleefully absurd story about the evils of 

nuclear war e amount of cut scenes almost 

matched the amount of gameplay which was 

continued for the series later installments like 

mgs 2 sons of liberty the franchises 

matrix reloaded equivalent mgs 3 snake 

eater my pick for best video game ever and 

mgs 4 guns of the patriots i still dont un
derstand what happened except one character 

needs a toilet
interestingly this does not apply to storylight 
gameplayheavy phantom pain which follows 

the story of big boss who aer suering a 

nineyear coma at the conclusion of ground 

zeroes phantom pains prequel game escapes 

an underattack hospital to formulate his own 

private military in order to hunt those who 

wronged him as big boss youre dropped into 

historicalera 1980s combat zones of afghani

stan and angola in an openworld setting you 

can partake in story missions sidequests or 

innocent exploring across the hostile terrain rife 

with enemy soldiers is is a stealth game and 

it behooves you to nd quiet oentimes non

lethal solutions to your missions though you 

can certainly run and gun your way through the 

game if you choose
and thats the games greatest gameplay 
mechanic choice while openworld game
play has been around since grand e auto 

popularized the concept in the mid2000s 

phantom pain takes it to another level with its 

rich environments that oer countless options 

for sneaking or blowing stu up if thats how 

you roll unlike previous games where the 
player more or less was forced to sneak past 

robotic predictable guards in a conned space 

any given base here has multiple ways inside 

while the guards sightlines was incredibly 

slim they always are in a metal gear game 

their movements are far less predictable e 

environment can also turn on you via sand 

storm rain or more which means every trip to 

any area in the game oers something new
as you progress through the game you 
are encouraged and other times demanded 

to extract knockedout enemy soldiers and 

bears if you choose to your military base e 

soldiers extracted join your organization and 

can be sent out into battle unfortunately not 

the bears as you earn more money complet
ing missions youll expand your base which 

you can use in online multiplayer against other 

players
yet metal gear solid has always been at its 
heart a single player game which is why it was 

surprising and disappointing to see that the 

attention to detail that so obviously was applied 

to the gameplay was not applied to the games 

story cut scenes are few and far between and 
multiple story threads are abandoned near the 

games conclusion
is is no doubt due in part to the games 
troubled development konami and game cre
ator hideo kojima take a drink every time you 

see his name plastered in the game i dare you 

parted ways during the games production and 

as a result there have been reports of multiple 

story missions that were simply abandoned as 

a result is results in a game that feels stilted 

undeveloped and lacking in the emotional 

resonance that permeated previous installments 

e games true ending does pack a punch its 

somewhat tragic for those who have followed 

the series thoroughly but otherwise a player cant 

help but ask his or herself aer 100+ hours of 

gameplay if it was all worth it
aer contemplation the answer is denitely 
yes as the detailed and enjoyable gameplay 

will keep you entertained hours on end it may 

disappoint those like me who played every game 

repeatedly and it may confuse others who are 

new to the series but otherwise phantom pain 

makes itself one of the most memorable games of 

this console generation for reasons good and bad
to tie the knot or not
i got my rst pregnancy talk from 
the dental hygienist aer being in 

my current relationship for all of two 

months when i moved in with my 

partner over the summer my mother 

talked about how ill soon be ready to 

settle down and start a family upon 

my return from a couples vacation 

my friend asked me if my partner had 

proposed when visiting family over a 

weekend my partners mother and my 

aunt each asked me so are you two 

going to get married
have i mentioned that im not 
pregnant at my partner is not keen 

on kids and that i myself have never 

decided one way or the other like 

you dear reader i am in college trying 

to nd out what to do with the rest 
of my life we have enough on our 

shoulders with school bills social life 

and world domination without having 

others add to the pressure by telling 

us that marriage and kids are what we 

need right now
dates are nervewracking enough 
without people putting pressure on 

your age your womb and their values 

someone always seems to be asking 

so meet anyone special you know 

back in my day  so when are you 

guys going to settle down and start a 

family eres a clash of values be
tween the generations beliefs between 

religions politician versus politician 

hygienist against patientwhocant

speakthroughdentalequipment 

everyone thinks they know best about 
how you should be living your life
when it comes to moving in 
together for instance everyone has an 

opinion some think marriage should 

follow immediately others constantly 

ask what if you break up for those 

who choose to move in together there 

is so much more to it it takes time to 

really get to know someone past the 

surface that everyone else sees rather 

than getting married while still discov
ering things they didnt know about 

their partner people these days are 

more and more oen taking the time 

to get to know each other intimately by 

living together 
eres also getting to spend more 
time together rather than taking up 

extra time to travel between places 
money can also be a driving factor by 

living with a partner people can cut 

their living expenses in half and at 

the end of the day sometimes you just 

want to curl up with a loved one and 

have someone around to chase away 

the nightmares 
moreover each relationship is 
unique because each individual is 

unique ose putting pressure on the 

relationship have no idea what you 

and your partner are going through 

ey will have a dierent take on the 

relationship than you will ey are not 

experiencing your relationship in the 

same way you are and what happens 

between a couple stays within that 

couple unless they decide to share so 

whoever is outside the relationship 
doesnt know all the factors going into 

your decision making 
additionally plans change and 
values change upon realizing that i 

would not in fact graduate aer just 

four years of college that i would need 

extra time to complete my classes i 

only panicked for a moment before 

realizing that i would be ne knowing 

that i had more time made me feel 

less stressed made me happier i also 

thought more and more about making 

a career for myself and maybe not hav
ing kids immediately if at all 
my partner and i have all the time in 
our lives to get married we have over a 

decade before kids become a yes or no 

question when the time comes it will 

be made between us and no one else

restaurant 
review 
eats from the far east
by juliana hart
bozeman is home to some of 
the most diverse cuisines for be
ing in such a rural state when 
you come to a country state like 
montana you expect to find 
steak potatoes hamburgers and 
general country dishes things 
you dont expect are good rep
resentations of mexican italian 

or chinese food  let alone 
korean
just off of main on the corner 
of willson and mendenhall sits 

a quaint little restaurant known 
as whistle pig korean this 
little shop is more than just a 
restaurant  it also hosts live 
music on fridays whistle pig 
korean is a great place to dine 
for pretty much any occasion it 
has a great datelike atmosphere 
if you and your date are will
ing to try something fun and 

exotic it might not be such a 

great place if you are looking 
for a high class fancyshmancy 
eatery but its a great place 
to introduce your family and 
friends too whistle pig is very 
unique as it offers glutenfree 
vegetarian and vegan options 
in fact most of their menu 

items are at least vegetarian 

with the option to add either 

beef pork or chicken
its also one of the best places 
to go to as a college kid the 

dishes are all very reasonably 

priced and the most expensive 
item on the menu is 12 which 
is actually pretty reasonable 
considering it is a large dish and 
has a lot of beef in it you will 

definitely be full if you order 

one of the larger menu items 

and they are therefore worth 

the 1012 it is also especially 

good for students as wednesday 

nights after 6 pm they hold 

a msu appreciation night 

on these nights if you order a 

bibimbap and have a msu id 

you will receive a free half order 

of mandu and a coke
whistle pig has been open 
since may 2014 they mainly 

serve the community itself and 

dont see a lot of college kids 
because they hadnt become 

aware of it until now the 

owner said that she opened 

whistle pig because it was her 

passion she had always loved 

cooking and she went to korea 

for a while while there she met 

her husband and they moved 

to bozeman when returning to 
the states she loved making 
korean food for her husband 
and since she loved cooking she 
decided to open a restaurant 

combining the two
whistle pig is a rather small 
place but still open the 

kitchen itself is openair al
lowing you to watch the food 

being made if you wish the 

walls are a bit sparse but are 

decorated in artsy pictures and 

brickwork despite being rela
tively small the seating is great 

without being crowded and the 

atmosphere itself is warm and 

welcoming 
the service at whistle pig is 
downright amazing depending 
when you go you can expect a 
small wait in line but it isnt 

too horrible to handle and it is 

most definitely worth it the 

woman who took my order 

was very nice despite the fact i 

severely butchered the names 

of the dishes i ordered and she 

made sure to double check that 

what i was trying to say was 

exactly what i actually wanted  
when i sat down to eat i was 
pleasantly surprised to find 

that the silverware consisted 
of a spoon and chopsticks if 
however you arent able to use 

chopsticks or are just terrible 

at using them you can request 

a fork i was very anxious to 
try my food i tend to be a 
picky eater and was terrified of 

going in blind i must admit i 

was pleasantly surprised the 

food was delightful and had 

the perfect explosion of flavor 

even picky eaters like me should 

be able to find something that 

they will enjoy with food like 

this whistle pig has definitely 

gained a repeat customer and 
next time ill bring my friends
japchae bap is made with sweet potato noodles and vegetables on a bed of 
rice and topped with bulgogi beef

despite being relatively small the seating is great without being 
crowded and the atmosphere itself is warm and welcoming

great shakeout are you ready for an earthquake
by john trapp
students faculty and staff learned to 
drop cover and hold this wednesday 
on oct 21 msu participated in great 
shakeout montana part of the world
wide great shakeout the largest earth
quake preparedness drill in the world 

tara moore director of the office of 

emergency management and emergency 
management coordinator said it gives us 
an opportunity to get the word out about 
earthquake preparedness
the drill took place wednesday at 
1021 am professors and teachers were 

asked to take a few minutes out of their 
class time to conduct the drill and there 

were even lesson plans online if they want 
to take the opportunity to ensure that 
their students prepare for an earthquake 

while participation in the event is not 
required we at montana state encourage 
all students faculty and staff to partici

pate in whichever way they feel necessary 

said moore an email sent by president 
waded cruzado reminded people of the 
event and encouraged students and staff 

to consider emergency actions they can 

take to protect themselves before during 
and after an earthquake 
staying safe in an earthquake requires 
taking certain precautions both during 
and prior to the event the first step 

according to the earthquake country 
alliance is to secure your space to do 
this move heavy objects to lower spaces 

also secure things like bunk beds moore 
notes secondly a plan for action after an 
incident should be formulated as commu
nications may be down due to the event 

or due to the overflow of people trying to 
contact each other
the third item on the list of precau
tions is to create a disaster supply kit we 

highly recommend that students in the 
dormitories here on campus have a go

bag in the case of an emergency moore 
stated a gobag could include things like 
food and water but also a first aid kit and 
proper clothing to possibly spend hours 
displaced into montanas brutal winters 

minimizing financial hardship is the last 
step in earthquake preparedness mini
mizing financial hardship can be done 

through structural checks and improve
ments and keeping important documents 

safe the earthquake country alliance 

notes that after the immediate threat of 
the earthquake has passed your level of 
preparedness will determine your quality 
of life in the weeks and months that fol
low
during and after an earthquake there 
are some essential steps to take to ensure 
survival the first one is to drop cover 
and hold on during the shaking you 

never want to move or try to go some
where during an earthquake moore 

said the people who do that suffer the 

most injuries after the initial tremor 

improve safety evacuate unsafe build
ings and areas help clear easy to mitigate 
hazards like broken glass and only use 
the cell networks if there is an immediate 
emergency or to send a short text message 

to an out of state family member finally 

it is time to rebuild help neighbors to 
reestablish the community and volunteer 
to help repair the damage as many other 

natural disasters have shown the only 
way to rebuild yourself is to rebuild the 
community

five students help run mountain bike world freeride tour stop
by tyler stitt
last week 42 of the best 
mountain bikers in the world 
competed on one of the most 

dangerous and challenging 
courses ever made for a 100000 
prize purse 
with representation from 11 
different countries riders from 

around the globe have highly an
ticipated redbull rampage each 

year since 2001 this year five 

msu students were invited to 
help run the prestigious competi
tion which included premiere 

access to the course and the 
athletes themselves 
the five students had one 
job help the athletes each were 

tasked with assisting a rider 
where they would help carry the 

bikes up the course or simply 

hangout at the dropin point 
with them for a bit while they 
figured out which line to take 

our job was at the bottom 
of the totem poll joked pat
rick rooney an msu student 

who helps build and maintain 

local bozeman mountain bike 

trails rooney continued  but 

you have the best access out of 
anyone you can be anywhere 
at anytime more so than media 
coverage
rooney amongst the other 
students slept atop an rv for the 
weekend along with a group of 

seven other campers from other 

universities most of the group 
had never been to the desert and 
were taken aback by how much 

they ended up enjoying it ian 
nagelbrice president of the 
msu backcountry ski club said 

his favorite part of the trip was 
sleeping on top of the rv  its 
an incredible feeling sleeping in 

the desert
going to bed around two in 
the morning and waking up at six 

am sharp each day was a long 

one averaging roughly 10000 
vertical feet per day made each 
hour of sleep that much more 
important however it wasnt the 

tough workout that was the chal
lenge nagelbrice said these 

were sketchy goat trails and we 
had a bike on our back if you 
slipped one foot you could re
cover but two youre done he 

continued there were certain 

places you just couldnt afford 

to fall
lorenzo politano an msu 
student said that regardless of 
how hard the hike was it was 
worth it i loved being up on 

the ridgeline politano said it 
was an intimate experience with 
the athletes i was able to watch 

these riders decide if they would 
push it to the next level and risk 
their life or just settle for fourth 

place  politano was helping one 

of the international athletes and 
said it gave me a new perspec
tive of rampage 
travel costs were covered by 
the sponsor of the event red 
bull which made the trip easier 
on a college budget nagelbrice 
said everything went super 
well he said i think the hard
est part of the entire trip was 
trying to find a parking spot at 
zion national park
kurt sorge a canadian took 
first redefining the highest score 
in rampage history with a 9650 
out of 100 andreu laconde
guy representing spain placed 

second with a 9575 followed by 
graham agassiz another cana
dian with a 9475
the group agreed that if 
theres one thing they learned 
from their trip it was to speak 

softly and carry a big bike

sexual assault a serious problem for everybody
msu police received 
a report of a rape 

which likely oc
curred in or around the johnstone 

center around midnight friday 

night i received this msu 

alert on saturday oct 17 

while i was at the voice 

centers annual retreat 

learning how to support 

and advocate for individu
als impacted by sexual as

sault among other issues
while bozemans crime 
rates are extremely low in 

comparison to other college towns 

we are still aected by the same 

issues that plague other campuses 

including sexual assault national 

statistics state that one in ve 

women and one in 71 men will be 

raped at some point in their lives
sexual assault is dened by mon
tana law mca section 455502 

as a person who knowingly subjects 

another person to any sexual contact 

without consent ere are a few 

situations in which an individual can 

not give consent including when 

the perpetrator is in a supervisory 

role over the victim or if the victim is 

mentally or physically incapacitated 
with that being said sexual as
sault does not happen on a spec

trum there are no gray areas there 

are no maybes either a crime was 

committed or it wasnt
while alcohol often plays a role in 
sexual assaults alcohol does not create 

criminals the average person does not 

drink alcohol and immediately think 

who can i sexually assault now yet it 

seems that far too often students place 

the blame on alcohol when they say 

comments such as they didnt realize 

what they were doing because they 

were drunk  they were both drunk 

so its wasnt anyones fault
if people want to place the blame 
on alcohol when discussing sexual 

assaults consider applying the same 

reasoning to duis  when an intoxi

cated person gets behind the wheel 

of a car they are held 100 percent 

responsible for all of the possible 

consequences e same goes for 

sexual assault when the perpetra
tor commits a crime regardless of 
intoxication on either partys part 

the instigator of the sexual acts is 

responsible for their crime just as any 

other criminal would be
campuses around the nation 
are focusing on sexual 

assault and doing their 

part through policies and 

regulations to prevent 

sexual assaults one such 

regulation is the clery act 

which requires colleges 

and universities  partici

pating in federal student 

aid programs to disclose 
campus safety information and im
poses certain basic requirements for 

handling incidents of sexual violence 

and emergency situations e more 

recent campus save act passed in 

2013 requires colleges with title ix 

funding to dedicate money and ef

fort towards sexual assault education 
msu is extremely lucky in that 
not only do we have a fantastic title 

ix oce housed in the oce of 

institutional equity but we also have 

the voice center e advocates at 

the voice center assist survivors 

of sexual assault through oering 

unconditional support as well as pro
vide survivors with various reporting 

options and resources
while the title ix office and the 
voice center are terrific resources 

that provide msu with a stable foun
dation for assistance outreach and pre
ventive education they cannot improve 

the culture on campus without the 

participation and commitment from 

members of the msu community 

students staff and faculty alike
we need to work as a unied 
body that understands the impor
tance of speaking out against rape 

culture and stepping up to prevent 

sexual assault every single one of us 

can make a dierence by doing our 

best to eliminate rape culture
rape culture simply dened 
is when societal attitudes towards 

gender and sexuality reinforce and 

normalize rape if we want to see 

a positive change on our campus 

we need to realize the detrimental 

eects that sexist language jokes and 

behavior have on our campus and do 

our part to eliminate such language 
and actions from our personal lives 

rough dissolving the pyramid of 

violence from the bottom up refer 

to visual we can work to eliminate 

problemcausing behavior 
it is important to realize that 
sexual assault is a crime of power it 

robs an individual of one of their 

most basic rights the ability to 

choose what happens to their body 
while breaking down rape culture 
is important it wont stop a sexual 

assault that is about to occur argu
ably one of the easiest ways to stop a 

possible sexual assault from occurring 

is through bystander intervention if 

you see an individual taking advan
tage of another individual that seems 

mentally andor physically incapaci
tated due to alcohol etc step in and 

make sure that the incapacitated 

individual has a safe way to get home 

preferably with trusted friends if you 

see anyone alter any food or drink 

report it to msu police department 

at 9942121 when youre in a public 

setting keep an eye on your beverage 

and dont accept any food or drink
most importantly educate your
self and others as the student code 

of conduct details legal consent only 

takes one form an armative yes 
i challenge the students of msu 
to step up and say something even 

when its easier to remain silent i 

challenge the students of msu to 

make a dierence aer all its on us

seifert likely have many things in 
    common theyre all gallatin county 
commissioners more importantly 
theyre all gallatin county commis
sioners who chose to prioritize 

their budget among other 

things over the safety of vot
ers in the upcoming elections 

undermining the democratic 
process a basic google search 
or middle school us history 

class provides that a democracy 
is a government by the people 
a form of government in which 

the supreme power is vested in the 
people and exercised directly by them 
or by their elected agents under a free 
electoral system the us is officially a 
democratic republic further emphasiz

ing that the authority lies in the hands 
of the citizens who are represented in 
their republic by elected officials as 

such it is critical that our country has 
the highest voter turnout possible in 
order that everyone is equally and fairly 
represented 
in choosing to move the polling loca
tion from the msu campus to hope 

lutheran church the commissioners 
also chose to move it to a location that 

requires voters to travel nearly a mile 
on 19th from kagy to the church  a 
stretch that does not have a sidewalk 

bike lane or shoulder in choosing not to 
fund a bus route servicing that location 
during elections the commissioners 
chose to endanger the lives of voters who 
dont have access to a private vehicle 
the commissioners decision to move 
the polling location on campus directly 

contradicts one of their most basic du
ties as public servants in a democracy 
to serve the people the commissioners 
are charged to serve gallatin county 
as a whole not just those who elected 
them into office they cant serve a 

population of voters if said voters cant 
vote and have their opinions heard in an 
election 
kiah abbey bozeman director of for
ward montana graciously took the time 

to provide the exponent with further 
affirmation other than voter safety that 
the msu campus better serves gallatin 

county as a polling location than hope 
lutheran church she pointed to msu 
as a central landmark in southwest 
bozeman the accessibility of campus by 
foot bike bus and private vehicle the 
important role polling locations play in 
minimizing confusion surrounding elec

tions the dense population of voting age 
adults on campus and finally that over 
a third of the voters served by 
hope lutheran church are be
tween 18 and 30 years old the 

same age demographic served 

by msu other than funding 
hope lutheran church is nei
ther more convenient nor more 

accessible than msu 
a recent editorial by the boz
eman daily chronicle stated 
that commissioners are getting an earful 

from liberal activists who accuse them of 

suppressing the montana state univer
sity student vote as a republican stu
dent i find that petty accusations that 

the republican commissioners chose to 
move polling locations off campus be
cause young people tend to vote in favor 
of the democratic party trivializes the 
issue at hand this issue goes far beyond 
partisan politics the opportunity to 
vote is a fundamental right guaranteed 
to citizens of the united states and 

msu students represent an important 

demographic of people historically 
one of the first and most crucial ways 
a group of people are oppressed is to 
limit their ability to vote it would be 
an exaggeration to say young people are 

being oppressed as a population in boze
man but its clear that they arent being 

valued on an appropriate scale 
perhaps the commissioners were influ
enced by their personal political views 

but they were also likely influenced 
by a recent shift to absentee ballots 
through the mail the budget as theyve 
said and a busy location at msu that 

involves more coordinating and pa
perwork than hope lutheran church 

none of these justify the commissioners 

decision however 
accessible voting 
for msu students 

transcends these 
issues 
forward mon

league of women

conservation vot
ers and disability 
rights montana 
met with the 
gallatin county 

commission and 
gallatin county clerk and recorder 
this past june to communicate their con
cerns with the change of polling loca
tion on oct 6 2015 gallatin county 

commissioners expressed their support 
to move two additional precincts to 
hope lutheran church for the upcom
ing elections in 2016 due to fairgrounds 

renovations 
at some point sacrificing pride for 
the betterment of the population is 
necessary to effectively lead leadership 
at msu and elected leadership in the 

greater gallatin valley need to step up 
for young people and encourage them 
to be involved their local government 

which is certainly not what theyve done 
in moving the polling location to hope 
lutheran church the commissioners 
made the wrong decision and its time 
for them to either move the polling loca
tions back to msu or provide a way for 
students to easily access hope lutheran 
church 
a central tenant of the american 
dream is that the 

us continues to 
improve for future 

generations i want 
my generation to 
understand that 

they each play a 
crucial role in their 
government how
ever the gallatin 

county commis

sioners have created 
an environment that 
hinders this goal 

the message that 
the county commissioners send with this 

decision is clear young peoples voices 

arent important enough to warrant 
reversing their decision
as elected public servants their main 
priority should be the constituents 
that they represent that constituency 

includes msu students and the com
missioners essentially axed a great major
ity of them from the voting populace 

when they moved the polling location 
somewhere that can hardly be consid
ered accessible with a few weeks until 
the elections its clear that the people 
have spoken polling locations need to 
be moved and the msu administration 

and gallatin county commissioners 
need to rise to the occasion and make 
the necessary changes

the campus duck pond is a popular 
landmark among the student body and 
community alike since its 2008 renovation 

the pond has transformed from blemishing 

muddy hole to charming public 

gathering site yet despite the 

new aesthetic upgrade the pond 

remains a potential source of harm 

for both its avian inhabitants and 

frequenting humans
e pond provides a habitat for 
local waterfowl however its small 

shape and limited volume can only 

sustain a nite number of ducks 

which means the 256000 renovation from 

2008 will be a recurring necessity to support the 

ever growing duck population overcrowding 

leads to sanitation issues similar to those that 

demanded the initial refurbishment ese 

issues are presented in the form of stagnation 

from built up algae and feces poor sanitary con
ditions extend beyond just the pond itself as 

the ducks wander from the pond and all about 

campus their droppings follow
human interaction with the animals is 
also concerning a primary motivation for 

visiting the pond is feeding the ducks and 
while some may nd the act therapeutic for 

themselves and benecial for the waterfowl 

throwing bread to the ducks has proven to be 

damaging bread can become such an abun
dant source of food that it attracts 

unnatural amounts of waterfowl 

to the pond in combination with 

attracting new wildlife the cur
rent inhabitants of the pond are 

inclined to lay more eggs further 

leading to overcrowding when 

the pond cannot sustain such an 

unnaturally large population of 

ducks the ducks begin to overgraze 
campus lawns e less that the ducks natural 

environment is able to sustain them the more 

the ducks become dependent on articial 

feeding furthermore the ducks compete for 

food that is thrown to them leaving some 

of the smaller ducks malnourished on days 

when food is scattered about so extensively 

that it remains uneaten it is le to rot bread 

is oen thrown onto the ground scattered 

amongst duck fecal matter feeding from 

a feces covered pond platter facilitates the 

spread of disease disease or infection is not 

just limited to the ducks either parasites 
responsible for swimmers itch are prevalent 

in montana and while it is not common to 

see students wading in the pond children 

tend to make the area their playground and 

at times head home somewhat damper than 

expected msus pond is susceptible to these 

parasites as they generally live in shallow wa
ters particularly near the shoreline which is 

where young children most oen make con
tact before being pulled away from the ponds 

waters other forms of harmful human 

interaction are more blatant than feeding 

let us not forget the blow dart incident from 

earlier this year where an individual found it 

prudent to shoot a duck with a blow gun
the location of the duck pond can 
be considered a hazard as well the 

pond is situated next to one of msus 

busiest streets 11th avenue has already 

claimed the lives of several ducks whose 

increasing population will only add to 

the number of fatalities besides being 

hazardous to the ducks the location 

also serves as an inconvenience to traf

fic the ducks often cross 11th in search 

of grass to graze impeding traffic in the 

process
the ducks migratory patterns can be 
lethally affected by the pond deriving 

its water from three different sources 

including a sump pump from sherrick 

hall the pond is not entirely natural its 

warm winter waters along with artificial 

feeding give the ducks a residence and 

reason to stay throughout the winter 

delayed or nonexistent migration is le
thal for waterfowl as some cannot survive 

the sudden onset of freezing weather
e pond while eye candy today could 
just as easily become an eyesore tomorrow 

overgrazed lawns feces covered sidewalks 

malnourished ducks and stagnant water 

could be the future of the pond unless 

of course a few more hundred thousand 

dollars were spent on renovations stu
dents could also stop feeding the ducks  

but that would take away from the ponds 

appeal still the most mutually benecial 

course of action would be to ban feeding 

the ducks without articial feeding the 

pond and its inhabitants would resort their 

natural tendencies perhaps students will 

nd that indulging in nature can be just as 

therapeutic as articial feeding

the importance of apathy in our society
lets be honest you probably dont 
care about this article you were just 
flipping through the paper to find the 

photos from last weeks volleyball game 

and the title happened to catch your eye 

normally youdve stopped reading by 

now but perhaps youre hooked now im 

just wasting your time which is why you 

shouldnt have cared in the first place
we live in a fastpaced world theres 
not enough time to care as college stu
dents were swamped with netflix chill 

sheshes and over three credits of classes 

how can we be expected to keep up with 

things like politics or global warming 

thats what scientists are for we have to 

focus on our futures in college and post
ing rants on facebook isnt going to get 

us there 
on top of that nobody even reads face
book anymore again if we cared 

what other people posted then 

wed actually have to read all of that 

stu eres only 15 seconds before 

netix starts the next episode of 

always sunny theres no way you 

could read the comments on an 

article someone shared let alone 

the content itself
scientists are starting to prescribe 
apathy as a cure for stress sleepdeprivation 

and even emotion in general dr neve 

stichols science expert told us that theyve 

noticed an increase in apathy linked to an 
increase in student wellness on campus 

lucky for us studies show montana states 

levels of apathy are the highest in the entire 
gallatin valley approximately 

37 percent higher than bozeman 

high 
is might not be the case for 
long though clubs and activists all 

across campus have made it their job 

to make people care e center for 

disease control projections show 

that levels of apathy could drop by 

almost 30 percent in the next ve 
years montana hall made no comment on this 

development if we keep doing things we would 

end up caring more than those people who yell 

about obama on tv and nobody wants that
our ability not to care is being threatened 
by people who do ey will stop at noth
ing to make us care about our surroundings 

when youre walking to class listening to 

that sick mixtape you made in your passfail 

music lab the last thing you want is for mor
ward fontana or that preacher guy to tell you 

about the government or god or something 
e solution is us keep those earbuds in 
tune out the noise and check instagram one 

more time make sure not to read the cap
tions because lets be honest you dont care 

one day it may be possible for all of us not to 

care but right now today there are still those 

that do all around us so for now we will all 

just have to keep not caring and hope they 

will too
oughts on the preacher assault from christian students
in sept 2014 a preacher who goes by 

the name shawn the baptist was 
peppersprayed on campus more recently 
multiple ghts have been started surround
ing a preacher on the mall and 

bystanders have again resorted to 
violence as evidence of their dis
approval according to his web
site shawn the baptist believes 
that a world view of tolerance 

and universalism are rampant 

at universities if a student is a 

christian on a university they 

are oen times ridiculed because 

of having a biblical worldview consid
ering that tolerance is a fair objective 

and permissive attitude toward opinions 

beliefs and practices that dier from ones 
own shawn the baptist is essentially the 
antichrist of his own personal view of uni
versities preaching condemnation in the 
openair to all that surround him
while he is correct in asserting that 
christians are far less accepted on modern 

university campuses than they used to be 

he is wrong in assuming that universities 

are centers for tolerance and universal
ism in an ideal world universities would 

be hubs of tolerance and universalism 

universities are a place where young adults 

should have the ability to discover the 
world around them and tolerance creates 

an environment where they can explore 
their options safely unfortunately both 
shawn the baptist and his attackers have 
proven that this is not the case 
shawn the baptist believes that 
one of the most loving things 
he can do is to tell others about 

his risen saviour  because he 

approaches this calling through 

a window of aggression and 

condemnation he rubs a lot of 

people the wrong wayfor good 

reason when ones beliefs are 
criticized judged or insulted as shawn 

the baptist does to nearly everyone who 

walks past him the instinctive response 
is to defend oneself with equal vigor and 
aggression in an openminded culture ten
sion and even direct opposition between 
beliefs should lead to introspection and 

ultimately a better understanding of why 

one believes in something while this is ap
parently the goal of shawn the baptist the 

way he approaches it is entirely contradic

tory to his beliefs as a christian and is not 

conducive to spreading gods love 
when he attacked fellow students due to 
an apparent slur surrounding a preacher 

in front of montana hall last week msu 

senior allen tarkon failed to condemn 
the slur and further validated what was 

said martin luther king jr who derived 
his pacist views from jesus believed that 
violence was the wrong way to confront 
important issues for two main 
reasons when one responds in a 
violent rage they are essentially 
welcoming more violence in re
turn e idea that a fundamental 

issue of humanity can be xed 

with a response more t to the 

rest of the animal kingdom is 

just wrong and minimizes the 

humanity involved in the issue 

humans are innately humane towards 

other humans in order to act violently 

against another human being one must 
rst reduce them to a level below their 
own 
as intellectuals we should encourage a 
questioning mind but as morally conscious 
beings we should do it in a more appropri

ate way that is conducive to a free exchange 

of ideas shawn the baptist represents him
self as someone who has no desire to re
spect other beliefs it is dicult to respect 

someone when they dont demonstrate 

respect for others especially as chris

tians we nd this repulsive god calls us 

to love others as he loved us is means 

respecting their choices even if we dont 
agree with them we chose to be christian 
but others chose to be muslim buddhist 

atheist etc it would be wrong to force our 

beliefs on others just as it would be wrong 
for them to force their beliefs on 

us instead one should focus on 

highlighting the similarities and 
understanding the dierences 
in choosing to be christians 
we the writers are choosing to 
admit our imperfections we are 
choosing to admit that our lives 
are not complete or whole or 
perfect but that there is a perfect 
god willing to accept our aws when we 
call ourselves christians it is a declaration 

that we accept his love knowing that we 
dont deserve it god tolerates us so we can 
tolerate shawn the baptist bravo shawn 

the baptist for further validating what it 
means to be a christian on a university 
campus it means being condemned by be
lievers and nonbelievers alike but choosing 

to have faith anyways however in doing 
so you have also created the atmosphere 
of intolerance that you apparently like so 

much one of the cornerstones of chris

tianity is free will e choice to believe is 
just as sacred as the belief itself we choose 
to believe whatever we want

neous food options e most wellknown vendor is the union market grill nothing unusual or 

exotic here  this is the spot if you want some good oldfashioned american food burgers fries 

and chicken strips are the focus at the grill and for college food they are actually quite good
across from the grill is pacic rim marketplace an asian selfserve market e food is a 
mix of various eastern cuisines and is a fairly good imitation of actual asian food of course it 

cant be called 100 percent authentic but its also not advertised as such ey also have takeout 

boxes if you happen to be in a rush
e other named location is sabrosos a mexican grill ey serve everything from enchi
ladas to burritos to vaguely authentic quesadillas e food is fairly tasty if a bit americanized 

 and if you have an idea what youre looking for they do have some options that are closer to 

mexican street food than taco bell
ere is also oatmeal a salad bar with a passable selection soups fruit baskets several soda 
and coee machines and a few other small options
all in all the union market is a pleasant if unexciting place to eat e ambiance couldnt 
exactly be called intimate  the tables are oen quite full e meals run about 7 on aver
age which isnt bad compared to real restaurants e food isnt gourmet by any stretch of the 

imagination but if you want a quick reasonably priced meal without any bells or whistles you 

cant go wrong upstairs
the union market
at some point or another we all get tired of dining hall food im sure that we all get crav
ings for food that is bad for our health but so good for our tastebuds we desire the diversity 

and there are many options beyond the dining halls on our beloved campus many housed in the 

subs bottom oor
wild flour pizza and pasta is one of my favorite restaurants in all of bozeman and especially 
on campus true to its name wild flour serves both delicious pizza by the slice and madeto

order pasta as well as breadsticks and salad
next to wild flour is bobcat grill e grill is home to a variety of burgers and a few sand
wiches ose burgers can be served with fries or tatergems e burgers and tatergems are fairly 

good  not the best you will ever have but still good e grill also now serves breakfast you 

have a choice of things like omelettes pancakes and the like i have yet to try the breakfast but 

hopefully it is as good as i have heard
now that you have had lunch would you care for some dessert ere are two other food 
shops under the sub e sweet shop will give you that sugar rush you are looking for freshens 

is a smoothie and ice cream shop connected to the sweet shop ready to satisfy your every craving

my tuesdays are hectic im stranded on campus from 1  9 pm due to this and the fact 
that i live o campus i get hungry while i could be a gogetter and pack a lunch my brain al
ways seems to neglect that as an option is makes me eat somewhere on campus or starve given 

that i have at least forty years of life le hopefully i choose not to starve to ease my inevitable 

starvation i usually choose to eat at avogadros number 
if you dont know where avogadros is its in the space between the procrastinator eatre 
and the union market in my humble opinion avogadros has the best food on campus ey 

serve primarily wraps and sandwiches but they also have a small premade section where you can 

buy something quick and get on your way its also aordable  all of their sandwiches and wraps 

are around 6 and they have a wide selection of drink choices i usually spend about 9 to get 

a wrap drink and some snack food while most of the campus food is oen greasy avogadros 

tends to be good for you i would recommend avogadros to anyone who is looking for a quick 

aordable bite to eat

vandals defeat cats in three close sets
by 
ian breuner
e montana state university 
bobcats competed against the 
university of idaho vandals on 

saturday oct 17 in shroyer gym 

msu lost to the vandals three sets 

to none 
e cats got o to a good start 
pulling ahead 84 in the rst set 

with the score at 129 the vandals 

went on a 41 lead to tie the score 

at 1313 tied at 16 apiece the 

vandals scored four unanswered 

points to take a 2016 lead and 

coast to a 2521 victory despite 

the loss i think they did a good job 

of focusing and moving on when a 

mistake happens head coach jj 

riley said 
e bobcats started o slow 
in the second set allowing the 

vandals took a 61 early lead a kill 

by senior natalee godfrey got the 

team rolling again and the bobcats 

went on a 137 run to tie the score 

at 14 apiece and force idaho to take 

a timeout following the timeout 
the vandals jumped out in front 

again before the cats tied it at 24 

apiece two unanswered vandal 

points closed out the second set 
montana state got o to another 
slow start in the third set and the 

vandals jumped to a 114 lead e 

vandals continued to build on that 

lead as the set progressed and led 

2013 e bobcats went on a 94 

run to bring the game within two 

points before the vandals closed 

out the game with a score of 2522 

e girls were mentally tough and 

focused on what they needed to do 

instead of the scoreboard riley 

said doing that allows you to 

come back like that e cats were 

led in kills by godfrey with 14 and 

kasey altman led in digs with 13 

we really focused on recovering 

and that was key to helping us get 

out of some of those ruts altman

bobcats fall short against undefeated eastern washington eagles
by ian breuner
the bobcats faced the no 1 ranked 
volleyball team in the big sky confer
ence thursday oct 15 in shroyer gym 
despite a tremendous start the cats fell 

to the eastern washington eagles 31 
montana state started off the first set 
with eyeopening energy opening up on 

a 51 run the bobcats set up a lead that 
would be sustained for the rest of the set 
leading 128 the bobcats went on a firey 

70 run before the eagles would score 

again securing a 198 lead that would 
be enough to put the ewu away with a 
score of 2516 the girls were focused 
head coach jj riley said they came 
out loose and aggressive i think they 

believed that they could win and they 

played like it 
the bobcats came out strong once 
again in the second set tying the score 

with the eagles seven times before estab
lishing a 1510 lead the eagles took the 
lead after being tied up twice more and 

managed to win the set 2521 
the third set was as much of a battle as 
the second the eagles managed to snag 

a late lead however and came out on top 

again to win the set 2523
the cats started off slow in the fourth 
set giving up five points before scoring 
later with the score at 105 the eagles 

went on a 70 run to take a 175 advan
tage over the bobcats the bobcats only 

scored three more times as the eagles 

took a commanding 258 victory in the 

fourth and final set i think that the big
gest takeaway is that the girls can decide 

what happens riley said they can play 

with anyone if they believe in that
the bobcats were led in both kills and 
digs by freshman chase doughty who 
racked up 13 kills and 11 digs chase is 
a dynamic athlete riley said she plays 

with a lot of intensity and her athleticism 
allows her to make those big plays
chase really brings a lot of energy 
senior natalee godfrey said she hits 

hard and takes care of business on our side 
of the net godfrey followed up with 11 
kills and sophomore kasey altman added 
10 digs

bobcats prove worth in 
national competition
by andrew waters
both the montana state mens and 
womens cross country teams travelled to 
louisville kentucky to compete in the 
prenationals race on saturday oct 17th 
eleven nationally ranked teams took to 
the eld at this competition with 73 mens 
teams and 80 womens teams due to the 
sheer amount of teams at the meet they di
vided the race into two divisions red and 
black with the red division being seeded 

teams e montana state mens team raced 
in the black unseeded division while the 
women took on the best in the country in 
the red seeded division
  in the black division the bobcats took 
20th out of 31 teams junior diego leon 
was the rst to reach the nish line placing 
49th in at 2459 e rest of the seven cats 
nished within a minute of each other e 
only exception was senior jake turner who 
returned aer being injured during the rst 

race of the season msu combined for a 
respectable showing but ended up looking 
up at defending big sky conference champ 
weber state who placed 17th liberty 
university out of virginia won the black 
division
e womens team took 42nd out of 45 
in the red seeded division with freshman 
alyssa snyder leading the way with a time of 

2258 58 seconds behind the winner while 
snyder headed out at her own pace the 
rest of the team put together an impressive 
eort with six runners nishing within 30 
seconds of each other conference foes east
ern washington took 13th and even more 

impressive last years conference champions 

weber state took eighth with all three 
schools competing in the upper division 
the strength of the big sky conference was 

on display most of the schools they were 
competing against schools have double and 
some even triple the enrollment numbers 

almost every major ncaa division i 
conference was there
in the mens seeded division omas 
curtin of virginia tech a senior recorded 
his rst ever cross country victory omas 
beat out favorite and twotime defending 
champion junior edward cheserek of the 
university of oregon by more than four 
seconds with a time of 23 minutes and 18 

seconds e university of colorado won 
the overall meet and in second was the 
notorious university of oregon
both teams have shown continual 
improvement as the season rolls on with 

splits between them getting shorter the 
team hopes to use space to ensure the pack 
of runners stays with them hoping to use 
this team approach the bobcats have their 
biggest race of the season on oct 31 in ce
dar city utah as they hope to challenge all 
of the big sky conference and be crowned 
bsc champs
defensive disaster
road woes continue for cats
by davis connelley
another road trip and  another dismal 
outing for the montana state bobcats 
against portland state university on oct 

17 the bobcat defense didnt register a stop 
until late in the third quarter allowing eight 
straight touchdown drives to the vikings 
e oense tried to keep the cats in the 
game but the daunting task of scoring every 
possession proved to be too much and 
msu lost 5942 and dropped to 33 on the 

season
ings started o well enough for the 
cats when junior dakota prukop took the 
ball 61 yards on a quarterback sneak on the 
third play of the game to draw rst blood 
however psu answered immediately and 
scored on their rst play of the game with 

poor tackling and poor positioning turning 
a routine otackle run into a 79yard td 
scamper with fewer than two minutes o 

the clock it was clear the cats were in for a 
dogght 
e teams traded blows to a 1414 
stalemate with neither defense looking 

particularly capable of stopping the prolic 
oenses until the cats went threeandout 
twice in a row and portland state capital
ized e vikings ran rampant over the 
bobcats paper thin defense and gave them
selves a 14point cushion while the bobcat 

oense stalled out is early second quarter 

lead would prove to be the dierence maker 
in the game and the cats would never close 
the gap 
if things looked bad in the rst half they 
only got worse in the second msu head 

coach rob ash elected to try an onside 
kick in an attempt to get the ball back right 
aer the break but the attempt failed and 
gave psu excellent eld position e vi

kings made quick work of whatever adjust
ments msu made at the half and scored on 

a quick ve play drive to double the cats up 
a 4221 while there were some second half 
highlights for the bobcats such as a 100 
yard kicko return touchdown by fresh
man logan jones and a forced fumble by 
sophomore mac bignell but ultimately the 
bobcats could not overcome the complete 
lack of execution on the defensive side of 
the ball allowing a near record number 

of rushing yards  465 56 points in three 
quarters and 32 rst downs the defense 
continues to unimpress showing no lessons 
learned or improvement aer last weeks 
acceptable performance against sacramento 
state the msu coaches cannot seem to 
crack the defensive conundrum poor lineup 

presnap poor tackling and poor pursuit 
angles continue to allow opposing of
fenses to have their way with the cats even 
through the seventh week of the season
with a home game against winless and 
newly promoted east tennessee state 
university this weekend surely the bobcats 

will look to right the ship against a very 
poor team e cats better make the most 
of the learning opportunity because they 
hit the road in two weeks to face a resurgent 
north dakota program etsu has not won 
a game this season and has lost to a division 
iii school so when the game kicks o on

 15misadventuresunder the big sky
stuck up the 
 banana couloir 
without a skiby 
theodore
 grover
e longrange forecasts looked like 
absolute garbage and the snow seemed 
perfect i suppose if it hadnt been for that 
fact i mightve turned around when my 

rst touring binding broke or maybe aer 
we ended up more than a mile o route in 
the wrong direction by that point we had 

been aimlessly skinning around the bracket 
creek drainage all aernoon and were no
where closer to ross peak however things 
were looking up we had now righted our 

course and were within reach of the base 
of ross and its aesthetic banana couloir 
indeed it seemed that aer a string of blun
ders we had stumbled into some good luck 
ats when my second touring binding 
snapped leaving me wallowing in waist

deep snow miles from the trailhead
it was early aernoon by the time we 
nished classes and got to the trailhead 

my friend and i were planning to ski the 
banana couloir that day so named for its 
bananalike shape down the southeast face 

of ross peak unfortunately the tour was 
doomed almost as soon as it began my 
rst binding cracked nary a half mile from 

the trailhead one of my atomic track
ers sheared where the base plate meets the 

toe piece e touring capabilities were 
compromised but the binding would still 
function in downhill mode is le us 
with a peculiar dilemma as long as i could 
get to the top of the line i would still be 

able to ski down safely 
neither of us wanted to turn around that 
aernoon as the conditions were absolutely 

perfect e skies were blue the air was 
cold and the snowpack was stable fur
thermore the long range forecasts looked 
exceedingly hot with forecasted highs in 

the 60s for later that week in january no 
less my friend and i both realized that if 
we didnt ski the line that aernoon there 

was no guarantee the conditions would line 
up as favorably again that winter it seemed 
that this day might be our only  and 

best  shot is dangerous rationalization 
ultimately skewed our judgement heavily
we decided to press on at least a little 
further using electrical tape and rubber 

ski straps we managed to directly attach my 
boot to the bindings toe piece essentially 

creating a poor mans tech toe e jerry
rigged repair worked surprisingly well 
allowing us to skin several more miles with
out incident e only downside was that 
most of those miles were spent traveling in 

the wrong direction we made a wrong turn 
shortly aer my binding broke and ended 
up somewhere in the vicinity of texas 
meadows well south of ross peak 
our mistake proved to be a costly one 
upon realizing where we were a review of 

the map revealed us to be over a mile south 
of the base of ross once again we weighed 

our options we probably had roughly two 
hours of daylight le to work with and 
one and a half miles to cover before we 

would top out on the couloir e ridge was 

beginning to cast an aernoon shadow over 
bracket creek a casual reminder that we 
were running out of time 
if wed been smart we wouldve turned 
around when my rst binding broke if 

wed had half a brain we would have turned 

around at texas meadows and cut our 
losses turns out we had less than half a 
brain because we kept going e lure of 

deep stable powder was just too hard to 
ignore our steadfast determination to ski 
the banana couloir was insurmountable 

we would not be defeated by a broken bind
ing and a wrong turn is was my mindset 

when the banana couloir came into view 

ahead of us it glowed in the aernoon sun
light beckoning us forward it was nally 

within our reach
e electrical tape that had allowed me 
to keep skinning came undone about a half 
mile from the base of the line i began to 
tape my boot back into the binding but 

didnt get far at that moment my second 
binding broke shearing just like the rst had 
a couple hours beforehand i sunk up to my 

waist in the snow allowing the gravity of the 
situation to sink in i was standing in waist 
deep snow with two broken bindings miles 

from the road with sunset fast approaching 

e tour was over 
e ski out to the road was miserable i 
had to ski back to the car on one ski because 

the second broken binding didnt snap as 
cleanly as the rst i arrived back at the car 
exhausted and bitter it wouldve been one 

thing if a poor snowpack or poor conditions 
had forced a retreat but to be turned back 
due to equipment failure stung in a winter 

dened by poor snow and warm tempera
tures wasting one of the few good days of 

the season felt unacceptable but i wasnt 

done with ross peak as i drove back to 
town my determination to ski the line only 
grew larger i knew i would be back to settle 

my debt with the banana couloir
in praise of injury time o can lead to unexpected benets
by parker webb
regardless of the sport getting 
injured is not a fun time your acl 
gives out skiing an ankle breaks ice 

climbing a rotator cu tears while 

sending your project there cannot 

be any good news from an injury 

right wrong while an injury is 

normally not good there is a value 

to forced time o from an activity
 odds are if you go to msu 
and are an outdoor enthusiast you 

eat breathe and sleep your activity 

class time is spent daydreaming 

about the next powder day rip
ping the single track down garnet 
mountain or clipping the chains 

of your latest sport climb when 

you meet up with pals all that you 

talk about is the collective similar 

interest in that sport dreams are 

of the perfect outdoor lifestyle  

perfect turns on a splitter powder 

run and winning that cyclocross 

race injuries stop the pursuit of 

your sport immediately and with 

no warning all of a sudden instead 

of spending every aernoon climb
ing youre stuck in town unable to 

do anything it seems like no value 

can originate from not being able to 

crush on a daily basis yet there is 

look at it this way suddenly there 
is all this free time you can catch 

up on school work nd another 

hobby doing the same activity 

day in and day out is in fact not 

healthy variation is a necessity 

and injuries allow you to nd and 

pursue other passions allowing 

yourself to be a wellrounded 

individual
got an upper body injury take 
up a sport that only uses the lower 

half of your frame like running 

not a runner you say no problem 

now is the time to start do it for 

fun from a beginners mindset a 

skier with a torn acl go work on 

balancing out that lower body mus
culature with upper body workouts 

invest your time into studying a 

subject you know nothing about
currently i am recovering from 
a shoulder injury from climbing at 

rst my time was spent ounder
ing not knowing what to do so i 

went back to slacklining and run
ning sports i hadnt done for years 

new personal records were broken 

i still had fun i checked out cyclo
cross races cheering on friends that 

crush in that realm im missing 

rocktober and missed the end of 

sendtember but that doesnt mean 

i have to mope around and not 

have fun taking a new perspective 
allows for injuries to have a silver 

lining  opening doors where oth
ers get shut
accept the fact that injuries 
happen and learn from them 

become a more rounded individual 

try new things actually do your 

school work on time try not to 

get injured but more importantly 

recognize that climbing biking 

skiing or whatever other sport you 

choose are not the most important 

things in the world plus once you 

come back to your sport think 

about how much more excited you 

will be when you havent done it for 

months

renovating from 
schwag
 to miller mediocrityby adam waldorf
well that was underwhelming 
was my initial response aer leav
ing miller dining hall for the rst 
time this year aer a seemingly 
endless amount of renovations 
made to miller in the past year i 
was expecting something much 
more impressive than i was given 
allinall i wasnt impressed with 
what the new miller dining hall 

has to oer
allow me to clarify i was one 
of the sorry souls who had to deal 
with eating in miller last year dur
ing the construction for the rst 
semester i was plagued by dust 

loud construction equipment and 
inconsistent food which made me 
fed up no pun intended it only 

got worse as the second semester 
started instead of actually being 
treated to a dining hall everyone 

was limited to one line of dry 
burgers and some french fries or 
a cooler that was stocked to the 

brim with soggy sandwiches and 
dirty salads is made me walk 
across campus to eat at the other 
dining halls for every meal by 
the time the end of the year rolled 

around i was content with never 
eating at miller again
en this year rolled around 
and i heard that the new miller 

was impressive with an interior 
that looked incredible and food 

which was leaps and bounds bet
ter than it was in previous years 

which lets face it didnt take a 

whole lot being one of the people 

who had to eat in miller last year 
i was awarded with ten free meals 
for this semester so i decided to 

take advantage of this opportunity 
and eat at the dining hall
my rst impression when walk
ing into the dining hall was spec
tacular e inside looks beautiful  
it has a modern feel to it and is 
much more organized than it had 
been in previous years e layout 
is separated into areas where you 
can get burgers noodles pizza 
coee sandwiches or breakfast it 
is all neatly organized and looks 
amazing ere are many more 
places to sit as well with the back 
portion being expanded as a 
whole i was impressed when i rst 
saw what they had done with the 
place
en i ate the food
for the rst semester last year 
the menu included cardboard 

pizza weird casseroles that never 
looked quite right and fruit that 
was only fresh half of the time 
it got worse the second semester 
where the food was completely 

inedible i had a lot of my friends 
tell me that the food was a signi
cant amount better in the dining 
hall this year ey were right e 
food was much better than it was 

last year but honestly it didnt 
take much for this to happen 
rather than having something 
dierent every day like in previous 
years the new miller has stations 
where you can get dierent kinds 
of food e big problem with 
these stations is the lack of variety 
each station serves the same food 
every day making the variety 
aspect of the dining hall nonexis
tent while the food is better than 

it has been in the past it still isnt 
very good my food was dripping 
in grease leaving me searching for 
a place to wash my hands i wasnt 
as impressed as everyone else 
seemed to be
if you have a meal plan at 
the dining hall miller is a good 

choice it has the best dining hall 
food on campus otherwise its 
not worth the absurd prices 8 
or 9 to eat there i would highly 

recommend eating anywhere else 
on campus such as in the sub 
before eating at the new miller 
dining hall youll probably save a 
few bucks to eat much better food

looking for something funny well fear 
not  youll be able to nd it this upcoming 
wednesday oct 28 e something funny 

improv club will be putting on a show at 7 

pm in sub ballroom a is is the clubs 

rst show of the school year and it will be 

both free and familyfriendly
for those who arent familiar with 
improv its essentially spurofthemoment 

acting it requires a lot of quick creative 

thinking on the actors part as well as a fair 

amount of theatrical and comedic skill 

longform improv basically equates to a 

oneact play made up by actors on the spot 

whereas shortform improv is made up of 

shorter skits and games if youve ever seen 

the show whose line is it anyway then 

should be familiar with shortform improv 
something funnys upcoming show will 

consist entirely of shortform improv during 

which the club will split into two competing 

teams both teams will perform a few short 

scenes  in the form of games  and at 

the end the audience will be able to vote for 

which scene they liked better
is is only the second year that some
thing funny has been in operation it was 

founded last year by the clubs cocaptain 
alex tita i noticed that we had a lack of 
ne arts programs here at the university 

and that really bugged me so i decided that 

something needed to be done about it tita 

said he decided to start a club focused on 

improve because its what he knew best
something funny has around ten core 
members who show up to meetings regu
larly in addition to a handful of other mem
bers who pop in sporadically e club is 
always open to newcomers  no experience 

necessary e everchanging nature of their 

group adds another element of spontaneity 

to their performances which is why no two 

shows are the same
we have a lot of new talented people 
this year and every time someone new 

comes into this club they bring a dierent 

brand of humor with them tita said a 

scene with michael helen tyler and me 
will be much dierent than a scene with 
dean karl and ivan 
wednesdays show is free and thats the 
plan for most of their shows i dont feel 

comfortable asking for money for what we 

do because im not doing this because i 

expect compensation tita said im doing 

this because i want to spread this art form 

karl ohaus another member jokingly 

chimed in i joined this club with the 
expectation that i would be hired by snl in 
a couple of years 
from there the jokes kept on rolling 
were basically all vampires that need to 

feed o of the energy of an audience club 

secretary tyler weil explained
its heavily implied that something funny 
will happen at the something funny improv 

show weil said so if youre looking to 

have a great time on a wednesday check out 

the something funny improv clubs show 

 its free its fun and its conveniently 

located right on campus what have you got 

to lose
msus improv team wants to make you laugh
the show is 
wednesday 
oct 28 at 7 pm in sub

a admission is 
free
dragons and space and marching band oh my
by  
juliana
 hart
as you may have noticed the 
last few marching band shows have 
been down right amazing perhaps 
you arent quite the band enthu
siast but you can still appreciate 

what nathan stark the spirit of the 
west marching band director man
ages to create year aer year
e marching bands most recent 
show dragons featured music 
from game of rones and how 
to train your dragon to create 
this show band members marched 
into the shape of a dragon growing 
from an egg to an adult before the 
grand nale  ghting a human 

knight e wonderful dragon that 
the band creates then defeats the 
human opponent in battle 
eir next show for the rest of 
this season is titled space music 
is show includes music from 
2001 a space odyssey e 
final countdown flash gordon 
and even a little star wars which 
was the basis of the show to begin 
with
stark has a fascinating method 
for choosing and choreographing 

shows his rst show is always cho
sen by himself and assistant direc

tor stephen versaevel e second 
show is at least partially chosen 
by the members of the band e 
directors still have veto power but 
stark says he does his best to meet 
the needs and desires of the mem
bers of the band  a welcome 

change from many directors who 
prefer to do it all themselves 
several band members said 
that they like this system and 
that it is always fun to work with 

the directors and nd common 
ground it is especially important 
to work together as a team because 
the band has a very short time 
within which to rehearse both their 
music and their shows despite the 
limited time span however stark 

is adamant that the spirit of the 
wests quality is on par with other 
universities in the us  even 
bigger schools with larger bands in 
fact some say they are better than a 
fair few of those bands
stark has been writing drills the 
show is commonly referred to as a 
drill by those in the band since he 
was in college he spent a summer 
learning the soware choreogra
phers use called pyware then began 
to write drills for rural high school 
bands stark eventually became 
skilled enough at creating these 
drills to write for his own college 
band he has been writing ever 
since and frequently takes inspira
tion from drum and bugle corps
creating these shows and writing 
the drills for them is very complex 

stark said e directors have both 

a lot and little artistic freedom 

ey are free because no one has 

ever told them that they cannot do 

something or that they have to do 

something else however they also 
have restrictions on that freedom 

because of limitations in what the 

band can actually pull o 
audience members occasionally 
can be heard criticizing the band 

for not having more elaborate drills 

or moving faster ese people for
get however that the band has the 

task of playing their instruments 

making sure the music sounds good 

as well as remembering the drill 
and where and when they need to 

move ey essentially have to be 

perfect where perfection cannot 

exist 
aer having seen e spirit 
of the wests shows last year and 

dragons this year many students 

and community members alike are 

eagerly awaiting space music 

which premieres at the home game

merry melodies visits the museum of the rockies
by amy gill
explosions of acme products and the 
sounds of classical music blast from the 
museum of the rockies newest exhibit e 

warner bros cartoons that we all came to 

know and love are back for a limited time 

and once again are appealing to all ages stu
dents and visitors alike will be reminded of 

lazy saturdays spent watching pepe le pew 

attempt to woo a cat and the tasmanian 

devil lose his temper 
e museums tworoom exhibit consists 
of all kinds of warner bros artifacts from 

model sheets to story sketches and back
ground paintings all of the production 

art is from the 30s to the 60s warner bros 

opened in 1930 when even six or seven 

minute cartoons took several months to a 

year to create 
marketing director mark robinson stat
ed that the exhibit which shows pieces that 

are currently being rented from a representa
tive took about a week to set up besides 

artwork and information boards the exhibit 

also includes two projection screens one set 

up in each room of the exhibit visitors to 

the museum can sit in front of the screens 

and watch the famous cartoons for as long 

as the museum is open robinson said that 

his favorite character is marvin the martian 

as well as his dog k9 because marvin un
like other warner bros characters can come 
out on top and be almost equal to bugs 

bunny 
surprisingly the cartoons were not largely 
popular in their own time during their 

nest years of production people did not 

consider them worthy of serious attention 

ough television helped bring more atten
tion to the cartoons warners cartoon di

vision was shut down in 1969 e cartoons 

were later rediscovered in the mid1970s in 

spite of the limited audience of their time 

in 1943 critic manny farber said of the 

cartoons the good ones are masterpieces 

and the bad ones arent a total loss
another important point to note about 
the warner bros cartoons is the way they 

are presented to the audience one of the 

many information boards placed on the 

walls around the exhibit notes that the 

warner bros cartoons are noticeably dif

ferent from the so and sentimental and 

storybookish disney e warner bros car
toons are unafraid of violence as opposed to 

disney which is famous for its princesses  

as warner bros storyman michael maltese 

stated we wrote cartoons for grownups
e museum is known for its dinosaur 
displays and planetarium shows but noth
ing really beats a good cartoon students 

who drop by the museum are welcomed in 

with open arms and a discount on the entry 

fee in the words of porky pig tththats 

all folks
the 
warner bros exhibit will be presented at the 
museum until jan 31 2016 
tickets are 10 for students 14 general admission

msu introduces supercomputer to campus
by seth urick
msu has added a functioning 
supercomputer known as the hya
lite cluster to its list of resources 
available to researchers on campus 
able to perform complex simulta
neous calculations through a system 
of computational cores the cluster 
consisting of 44 nodes for a total 
of 1408 processing cores is being 
used for computational research by 
50 users from 11 dierent academic 
departments in ve unique schools 

while much smaller than clusters at 

larger institutions the cluster may 
be largest in the state of montana 

according to jerry sheehan chief 
information ocer of the msu in
formation technology it center
located in the basement of ajm 
johnson hall the cluster provides 

a powerful community resource 
for researchers at msu roughly 

speaking about two years ago 
we started as a university to have 

conversations about whether we 
needed to have a more generally 
accessible resource for people who 

dont have the opportunity to bring 
in federal grant money sheehan 
said e university decided it 
would be more interesting to build 
a community resource rather than 
the individual resources that we 
have had in research labs and that 

was the genesis for what we are re
ferring to as the highperformance 

computing cluster
e campus has a history of 
small clusters created for individual 

use in order to create a commu
nity resource sheehan and the it 

center worked with the oce of 
the provost and individual faculty 
members to pool money allocated 

to incoming faculty for equipment 
is money used for outtting labs 
obtaining equipment and hiring 
sta was used to fund the hyalite 
cluster is allowed the depart
ment to meet the facultys indi

vidual needs and create a resource 

more generally available to other 
researchers with computational 
questions
faculty members who gave 
money to start the project are 
guaranteed a certain number of 
computing cores for their research 

e rest of the academic commu
nity is able to access the available 
cores on a rstcome rstserve 

basis according to a queue
e fall 2015 semester is the rst 
academic semester in which the 

hyalite cluster has been broadly 

available to the montana state 
research community e cluster 
was installed in january of last year 

aer initial testing of the system 

a few users were allowed to use 
the cluster to further evaluate its 
performance in the spring and 

summer new users began using the 
cluster in addition to those in the 
testing group
e hyalite cluster can be 
upgraded further for more process

ing power computational power 
is increased by adding cores to a 

rack system which according to 
sheehan provides a high density of 

computation with a limited physi

cal footprint if the computational 

resources required by a user exceed 
that of the hyalite cluster bozeman 
it will assist researchers in gaining 

access to more powerful systems at 

other locations
as work with the hyalite cluster 
continues the it center plans to 

use existing hardware and soware 

like that used in hyalite to create a 
new cluster available as a resource 
for students e student cluster 

currently nicknamed the champ 
cluster until ocially designated 
will provide students with an op
portunity to participate in data 

science competitions or even to test 
their own ideas in sandbox type 
setting
if you were a student much 
like if you were a researcher and 

you wanted to look at something 

you would have to go through 

some training from us and then we

investigation of sigma alpha epsilon fraternity complete
by julie do
naga
nduring september two inci
dents occurred in hawks 
ridge condominiums often called 
the block which led to the 
interim suspension of the sigma 
alpha epsilon fraternity sae 
e use of date rape drugs was reported on 
sept 11 and a physical assault took place 
which resulted in student injuries on sept 18 
as well as another drugging report that day 

for both of these incidents an msu timely 
warning was issued in the second timely 
warning it was announced that sae had been 

placed on interim suspension
e investigation which was conducted 
by sae national headquarters the dean of 

students and the bozeman police has been 

now concluded dean of students matt 
caires stated that evidence of conduct viola
tions including sexual assault and underage 
drinking were found during the investigation 

although no evidence was found that sup
ported students being given date rape drugs 

it was concluded that both incidents involved 

members of sae
it has not yet been decided what the 
outcome of the investigation will be for sae 

caires hopes to issue outcomes within the 

next two weeks we are drawing conclu
sions that members of sae were involved 

with both incidents and because of that we 

are coming up with what the fair outcome 

should be for the student organization 

caires said some of the members werent 

there so should the fraternity be punished 

for a handful of members involvement 

ats what were working through
e dean of students oce and sae na
tional headquarters will also meet with sae 

student leadership to discuss what they think 

is a fair outcome  we dont like formal 
conduct hearings it automatically makes the 
university adversarial with students we want 

to resolve conduct matters informally caires 
said he added that two years ago interim 
restrictions for fraternities pi kappa alpha 

and sigma chi were resolved successfully in a 

similar manner
while caires did not want to release too 
much information before discussing the 

outcome with sae he did indicate that the 

outlook is good ere is no evidence that 
we have discovered that would permanently 
ban sae at this point i dont see the univer
sity saying that the behavior was so egregious 

that we are going to disband sae i dont see 

that being an outcome here caires said he 

also stated that sae had cooperated with the 

investigation and have not had conduct issues 

since their suspension ey are managing 
their aairs safely and as far as we know in 
compliance with the conduct code
according to caires there have not been 
any complaints issued from e block since 

the second timely warning was issued ad
ditionally property owners have become more 

involved with the behavior of tenants living on 

their premises i always see student misbehav
ior as an opportunity to make the fraternity or 

the student group better caires said
caires said that the investigation has taken 
time because of the involvement of sae na
tional headquarters and the magnitude of the 

situation we would suspend any other stu
dent organization if there was ongoing danger 

if sae feels like weve picked on them we felt 
there was an ongoing danger to the students 
and we needed to take serious measures

of voting is researching candidates 

that reect your values she said 

then guring out the logistics of 

elections is easier
young americans for liberty 
also ran a free speech wall where

ive been to more bobcat football games than 
just about anyone reading this well except for 
my parents hopefully  thanks for reading 
karan and gary over the years the teams have 
improved the stadium has been renovated and 
attendance hits new records each year but one 
thing hasnt changed much at all while bursting 
at the seams at the opening kicko only about a 
third of the crowd bothers to show up for the start 
of the third quarter and thats embarrassing
look i get it many fans arent there for the 
football but for the social aspect surrounding 
the game like a mixer or halloween at bar ix 
people are there to see and be seen more than 
for the event itself when students actually 
watch the game many of them arent necessar
ily the most knowledgeable about the game 
ey cheer at the wrong times cant identify the 

down and distance and some are just too drunk 

to speak or stand ats okay too especially 

in the rst half because at least theyre loud 
but when the clock ticks toward zero in the 
second quarter fans rush out of the stadium like 
a poorly practiced re drill maybe they really 
have to go to the bathroom or something but 

more likely they are 

heading out to drink 
some nice coors 
light aer all it 

is the coldest of the 

beers and thats okay 
too when it gets not 
okay is when those 

fans chests painted 

and clothes color co
ordinated who claim 

to love football dont even bother to come back 

into the stadium to actually watch football and 

cheer on the team they say they support
aside from ticket and concession revenue 
part of the reason teams play at home to gain 

home eld advantage across the divide in 

missoula all i hear on social media and even on 

outlets like root sports and esp
n is how 
loud their ugly eyesore of a stadium is ey are 

proud of being as loud as possible and creating 

an advantage for their calc 101 dropouts  

oops i mean football team at washington
grizzly stadium you can bet that those fans 
were back in the place aer halime in u of ms 

stunning opening day win against then 
no 1 
ranked 
north dakota state university
compare this to our marquee games over 
the past few years catgriz games included i 

cannot remember a single occasion where the 

stadium was even 80 percent full for the second 
half kicko even for important playo games 
like i said earlier this isnt necessarily an msu 
problem but that doesnt mean that we as msu 
fans shouldnt try to x it 
i dont think banning reentry is the right 
choice as rumors have claimed however i think 

this is a problem that we the fans can solve on 

our own ive got a couple ideas to set us on the 

right path arranged from worst to best
1 if you must drink and im required by 

my editor to say that i do not condone 

binge drinking whatsoever drink so 

much before the game that youre still 

so drunk by halime that you dont feel 

the need to go do shots of jager in a 

parking lot in the middle of a football 

game and probably couldnt nd the 

way out of the stadium anyway
2 hide a ask in your pants for halime and 

do a drinking game based on the marching 

band  heres a fun one drink every time 

you see a socially awkward person
3 consider the idea that maybe just 

maybe you dont have to be com
pletely blitzed to enjoy a saturday 

aernoon football game
4 finally perhaps just drink responsibly 

during halime and try and make it 

back into the stadium given the 20 

minutes or more between quarters
 now i know that some of these ideas might 
seem a little radical especially number three 

but as an athletic program the cats deserve 

better msu head coach rob ash has nothing 

but praise for the fans and the home atmosphere 

at the press conferences aer the games he 

preaches of how much the teams energy benets 

from a strong crowd especially the students as 

fans we should hold up our end of the bargain 

and help the team out weve got a great stadi

um a great team and some great weather so far 
so theres no excuse furthermore the marching 
band is bigger and better than ever and puts on 

great shows that everyone should see ey de
serve as much respect as the team and shouldnt 

have to play to a mostly empty stadium 
above all else though we should challenge 
ourselves to at least be better than the griz

zlies and to ll our stadium and be loud for the 
whole 60 minutes not just the rst 30 i believe 

we can do it you can wait an extra couple hours 

to resume bingedrinking and i think the band 

and team would appreciate it i know your 

liver will hope to see you all at the game next 
weekend against southern utah itll be a big 
one more than that though i hope to see you 

at halime

i opened my eyes for the rst time 
when i was 16 i crossed the strait 
of gibraltar to spend some time in 
the markets of tangier morocco 
 i was so overwhelmed by the mass of shops 

merchants and gypsies that i was unable to 

focus on any individual detail butchers laid 

out meat and entrails on stands in 

the streets vendors sprayed water 

on fresh and not so fresh pro
duce and panhandlers chased my 

shadow chanting money money 

dinero processing the entirety of 

my new environment was nearly 

impossible
aer perusing a hookah shop 
i began to realize that i had yet to 

see a moroccan girl my age i ques
tioned a spanish guide who informed me 
that they were too young to be out i further 
questioned the burqas in my young ethno
centric mind i thought these people were 

imprisoned to my surprise i was told that 

the garments were liberating a burqa oered 

refuge to women ere were no concerns 

over using makeup to be acceptably attractive 

or being eyed on the streets e revelation 
made me feel as though i had been looking at 
the world through stained glass never seeing 

its true colors
in describing my travels it would be 
easier for me to state that the only conti

nents on which i have yet to set foot are 

south america and antarctica 
neverthe
less despite all the lands and cultures i have 

encountered my experiences are limited e 

world is incredibly dynamic so much so that 

it can neither be experienced within a single 

lifetime nor through a single medium in 

that i must stress how there is no substitute 

no alternative to perceiving life outside of 

actual experience 
no photograph no movie 
no book will ever surpass your imagination in 

allowing you to feel something foreign
i was enveloped by two clashing cultures 
in my upbringing as i was raised by a liberal 

romancatholic mexican immigrant moth
er during school years and a conservative 

baptist caucasian military father during sum
mers i felt as though i had to be two dier
ent people ough a dozen years ago i could 
not discern how benecial the situation was 
to me i later recognized the advantages of 
uidity in identity beyond empathy i could 
actually live another culture 
two years aer tangier i signed a military 
contract infantry school provided my rst 

opportunity for cultural immersion i had 

not initially considered any facet of the 

organization cultural but it was nonethe
less chauvinism masculinity and 

especially heterosexuality were 

heavily instilled becoming a source 
of measurement by which any sol
dier could be valued competition 
was an integral part of the infantry 
system status and social standing 
surrounded the most physically t 

heaviest drinking manliest most 
welltrained soldiers as a non
drinking tattooless virgin standing at ve

feetandseveninches tall weighing less than 
140 pounds i was an abnormal infantryman 
ose qualities also made me untrustworthy
two years into my military service i was 
provided my rst opportunity to live another 
culture arab culture however in the eyes of 
my immediate leadership i was not prepared 
to deploy despite my expert gunner status 
among other skillsets i could not be trusted 

in a combat setting 
no military training 
could establish my combat readiness in their 

eyes only an 11hour outing at a strip club 

could prove my title as infantryman 
roughout a yearlong tour i only had 
one opportunity for direct cultural experi

ence it was called visitor control detail 
which maintained an aura of punishment 
e responsibility to conduct the detail was 

cycled throughout multiple platoons of mul
tiple companies and it meant being pulled 

from missions for three to four weeks in 

summary the detail required drawing ten lo
cal nationals per one soldier e locals some 
underage with obviously false documentation 
stating otherwise performed various services 
around our base from 7 am to 6 pm for 
roughly ve american dollars all under the 

armed supervision of their military escorts 
while the other soldiers viewed this activity 
as punishing i pursued it as an opportunity 

for cultural experience by interacting and 
communicating with the iraqis at every given 
moment e army knew just as well as i 

did the importance of cultural awareness 

my entire unit had to attend classes on iraqi 
culture and we were all provided culture 
smart cards prior to entering the country 
a key to winning hearts and minds is being 
openminded
i strive to maintain an open mind both 
abroad and at home as foreign experiences 
are not just limited to military enlistment or 

out of country travels they can be encoun
tered within our own neighborhood i spent 

a summer interning at the gallatin rest 
home western media instilled in me the 
notion that it would be full of crazy racist 
old people abusive sta and strong odors 
another example of the misperceptions of life 
augmented by inexperience what i found 

instead was friendship in a man who had 

regretfully lived the entirety of his life having 

never le the vicinity of bozeman
an open mind and a willingness to experi
ence the foreign world of gerontology allowed 

me to discover my future career when 

informed of my pursuit of geriatric work 

people tend to ask like wiping old peoples 
asses ey do not consider social services or 
activities coordination or administrative work 

why because we program ourselves to lter 

perspectives through stereotypes as it is the 

only way we can visualize the foreign world 
we are compelled to understand the world 
we are compelled to understand life even 

in the absence of experience we nd ways 

to gain insight into the things alien to us 

with no physical evidence or experience of 
an aerlife or lack thereof the majority of 
the worlds population has some idea of what 

will happen aer death popular opinion is 

the foundation on which perspective is built 

in that sense those who have only known 

gerontology through televisions depiction 

of nursing homes will think sponge baths 

and spoonfeeding when forced to visualize 

geriatric work television like other medi

ums keeps the foreign world foreign life is 
not restricted to the connes of the digital or 
literary worlds life happens and no amount

integrative education should be available to all students
classical greek and latin education 
was composed of seven topics which 
aristotle called the liberal sciences ese 
were divided into the trivium 
 grammar logic 
and rhetoric and quadrivium geometry 

arithmetic astronomy and music is parti
tion is anachronistic to modern 
students why isnt music over with 
language where it belongs why 
does logic not dwell with mathe
matics such classication bemuses 
the rigid contemporary demarca
tion between science and the 

humanities modern conceptions 
of education hinge on separation 
of art and science but perhaps we 
need to take another look at such blending of 
disciplines e greeks considered mastery of 
all areas the only general and proper educa
tion why should a dichotomy prevail now
e about msu page lists four focus 
areas academic excellence very high 
research engagement and outreach and 

about bozeman it is signicant that re
search is a focus area for montana state and 

its no secret that this is a university devoted 

to science and engineering e sciences bring 

in the most money attract the most students 

and deliver the most prestige in keeping with 

academic tradition however msu does give 

a small nod to a wellrounded education
unless youve had some requirements 
waived youre familiar with core 20 which 

includes writing university seminar uanti

tative reasoning diversity contemporary is

sues in science inquiry research and creative 

experienceis program provides a veneer 

of holistic education but it has no integrative 

depth  rather than facilitating inquiry and 

student curiosity the core 20 classes are ei

ther remedial or an imposition ese require
ments are frustrating to meet not because they 

distract from a students degree program but 

because they are unstimulating e curricu
lum committees steering the program must 

rethink the program structurally core 20 is 

not too much but rather too little 
counterpoint to these universitywide 
requirements stands the honors college 

which provides a holistic and wideranging 

program it challenges all disciplines to 

address issues outside their purview classes 

like e art and science of medicine 

our 
nuclear age and texts  critics 
bring students of varying academic focus 

to a single table ese classes embrace the 

vitality of mixing arts and sciences activi

ties such as hike and read or master classes 

with the likes of eo wilson yann martel 

and douglas hofstadter 
  peerless thinkers 
pushing the boundaries of what we under
stand to be art or science  provide fodder for 
studentdriven discussion the best learning is 
selfmotivated not didactic
as much good as the honors college 
provides it encompasses only a fraction of 
students a subset that is already predisposed 

toward critical thinking and exploration if 
the msu administration wishes to 
send bold inquisitive and broadly
informed graduates into the future 

it must provide a holistic education 

for everyone is education must 

foster the intrinsic curiosity of all 

students
ere have been some prom
ising beginnings e design 

sandbox for engaged learning 
dsel headed by professor meta 
new
house recently began oering designdriven

innovative ideation oered in the spring 
brings engineers business and marketing stu
dents and art and design students together in 

groupbased projects that result in tangible 

marketable products engineers this class 

replaces junior design ege
n 310another promising trend is an 
nsf 
grant awarded to drs paul gannon ryan 
anderson and carolyn plumb of the college 
of engineering to study the eectiveness of 
integrating sustainability education into engi
neering curriculum dr gannon is a member 
of the core 20 cis steering committee 

e abstract states e technical emphasis 

in engineering alone can be a barrier for 
students to enter engineering furthermore 
students receiving only technical preparation 

are less able to approach complex problems 

involving multiple perspectives eg ethics 

economics social justice etc e professors 

hope that incorporating broader concepts 

of sustainability into engineering education 

will better recruit retain and prepare a more 

diverse population of engineers  
a great example says anderson could 
be fracking its a major engineering feat with 

overlap to several classes its also in the news 
a lot and has major societal impacts this 
would provide a natural coupling in the class
room without distracting from an admit
tedly rigid engineering curriculum students 
could learn about the mechanics of diusion 

through a porous media how fracking is 
modeled as well as the ethical and economic 
components of the industry
e barriers separating traditional dis
ciplines are becoming meaningless ethics 

infects biology design disrupts business his
tory informs engineering to foster holistic 
learning msu administration can do much  

i suggest a new model that provides students 

with the opportunity to take upperdivision 
classes in other disciplines for passfail this 
would provide access to more interesting 

classes with less pressure fostering curiosity  

msu can also oer more classes cotaught 

between colleges and programs or intro
duce seminarstyle classes that dwell on the 

margins of disciplines following the model of 

the honors college it can divert additional 

funding to programs like dsel and bring 

such resources to a wider pool of students 

action is required  i do think most of the 

ills facing the world wont be solved by a tech
nical solution anderson says and people 

have to value whatever cause technology is 
being applied to in an increasingly con
nected and hyperactive global community 
the silo model of education is decreasingly 

relevant  montana state has an obligation to 
its students to push learning into the bright 
and terrifying future

 11were not missoula  were worse sexual assault across the country
last april acclaimed nonction writer 
jon krakauer released his book mis
soula rape and the justice system in a 
college town to great controversy e 

book aims to look into the prevalence of 
acquaintance rape and the serious 
issues surrounding how the justice 

system handles it e problem 

isnt the content of the work itself 
or even the notoriously biased 
voice krakauer writes with but 

using missoula as the title as if 

missoula itself were the problem 
e book is an indepth case 
study that does yes use missoula 

as its example of something that happens 

all over america but the title undermines 
the thesis of the book keeping the idea that 
this is something that happens in mis

soula in peoples minds when they should 

be thinking this is something that happens 
everywhere 
its likely that krakauer was channel
ing e laramie project when titling 
his book a play also that uses a town as an 
example to point out something that is a 
problem everywhere whereas e laramie 

project uses the exceptional circumstances 

of matt shepard being beaten and le for 
dead for being a homosexual as an example 
in order to bring out the inadequacy of 

hate crime laws missoula talks about the 

infamous sexual assault cases that took place 
in the town which are not exceptional but 
happen every day all across this country 
ese issues have been back in the news 
lately with ums student newspaper e 
montana kaimin publishing a sta edito
rial on oct 14 telling the administration 
that they need to admit the dropping 

enrollment is due to the rape scandals 
from the previous years e issue gets 
messy because yes the enrollment drop 

could be correlated with the scandals but 

um is not worse than most other schools 
when it comes to amount of sexual as
saults and how the school handles them 

especially now in fact krakauer himself 

writes in the end of the rst chapter that 
the number of sexual assaults in missoula 
might sound alarming but if fbi gures 

are accurate its actually commonplace
e number of reported sexual assaults 
at um has stayed around 14 per year 

on their main campus since the scan
dals began while at msu the amount 

reported increased from four in 2012 

to 21 in 2014 e increase in reported 

sexual assaults is actually a good thing 
paradoxically as shantalle gaynor was 
quoted in an article for outside maga
zine saying when you see increased 
reporting it doesnt necessarily mean that 
theres an increase of crime it oen means 
theres an increase of trust 80 percent of 

sexual assaults actually go unreported so 
this shows peoples condence in the justice 
system to actually handle the 
cases all of this makes gathering 
statistically excessively dicult 
especially with no good statis

tic on how many collegeaged 
women are sexually assaulted each 

year in fact the department of 
justices inquiries dont account 

for sexual assaults that happened 
when victims were incapable of 
giving consent 
from the information that we do 
have we see that the number of re
ported assaults increases at um once 
the scandal started and msu soon 

follows based on student population 
and the number of reported assaults 

per year and accounting for the 80 
percent of assaults that go unre
ported msu still shows statistically 

more sexual assaults per student 
meaning we have just as much if 
not more of a problem krakauer 
naming his book missoula shis 
the focus from the national sexual 

assault problem and creates 
a bigger problem it 
makes people 
subcon
sciously feel like this is a problem related to 
missoula and not everywhere in the nation 
even here at msu it allows us to understate 
the rape issue on our own campus by saying 
well at least were not um when were 
statistically doing worse and we arent even 
talking about it e most troubling thing 
is not oen discussed the fact that over 80 
percent of sexual assaults are committed by 

nonstrangers and almost 50 percent are 

perpetrated by friends or acquaintances so 
the way that society views a rapist  a man 
in bush wearing a ski mask and brandish
ing a knife  is typically false and the real 
problem is closer to home 
sexual assault and how we handle it 
socially is a massive complicated issue 
and im not going to pretend to be smart 
enough to know the solution all i can do 
is start a discussion so that together we can 
gure out how to x this granted that is 
what krakauer tried to do with missoula 

i ask you not to think of sexual assaults as 

something that happen as isolated faro 
incidents because it is something that hap
pens everyday everywhere

scrutiny confusion over msu increased enrollment
msu officials are just as confused 
as students by the universitys 
increased enrollment director of admis
sions rwanda terrier has been a key 
figure of the central administration that 

focuses on increasing enroll
ment though she has been 
an integral component of the 
program she is still baffled by 

its accomplishments
we dont understand ter
rier claimed we try to make 

parking as inaccessible and in
convenient as possible we raise 

tuition rates and keep student 
to professor ratios high  yet 
we continue to break enrollment records 

i know we make money and students at
tend in record breaking waves but im not 

quite sure how terrier is not alone in 
her confusion though as other members 
of the administration demonstrate similar 

bewilderment
one would think that students would 
be repelled by such standards remarked 

msu president waldo cruzaldo but 
my tenure says otherwise i mean look at 
this desk a broken economy cant afford 

six different kinds of exotic wood some 
aspect of this system is working but for 
the life of me i just cant figure it out
the institution is the largest in the 
state and is best known for its working 

payphone unrealistic depiction of bob
cats and catapalooza a varia
tion of a flea market infested 
with desperate car salesman
like carnies aiming to entrap 
freshman for cult recruitment 

purposes
several years ago i entered 
the msu academic system pos
ing as a student to gain a better 

understanding of the inner 

workings of the university said 
cris p kreme vice president for student 

success i enrolled as a community 
health major but found myself apply
ing to the engineering department after 

three years of mandatory core courses 
in the performing arts field i feel i now 

have even less of an understanding of how 

students continue to attend
one theory surrounding msus success 
involves masochists and ailurophiles 
or cat enthusiasts another consid
ers arkoudaphobia or the fear of bears 
which purportedly makes the bobcat 
university a more attractive option than 

the griz university at first glance one 

wonders what compels students to contin
ue attending from 

unairconditioned 

buildings and dorm 
rooms in the sum
mer to overheated 

buildings and 
dorm rooms in 

the winter most 

inaccessible to the 

handicapped there 

does not appear 

to be a motivating 

force supporting 

retention 
im just as 
perplexed as you 
claimed msu 
student and sb 
parking permit 

owner stuart stu 

dent as he walked 

to campus from an f lot parking area i 

think theres a lot this university has to 
offer i just havent seen it yet
in a recent statement made by cru
zaldo to students and alumni regarding 
enrollment  she claimed she would like 
to begin by using the universitys business 

and financial strengths as an example but 
quite frankly i do 

not know what those 

strengths are
we may never 
figure it out added 
kris cashnow direc
tor planning and 
analysis i know the 

child development 

centers preschool is 

popular among our 

mustachioed male 

community and 

campus construction 

is a large attraction 
but it doesnt seem 
to add up just as our 
student bicyclists are 
unable to follow traf
fic laws our student 

body seems equally 
unable to relocate
meanwhile nearby rival university of 
montana struggles to manage declining 

enrollment and retention rates with its 

prioritize students model

freshman aspen starling was nally 
accepted by her peers party invitations and 

approving glances from those who frequent 

the outdoors have increased dramatically 

since starling purchased the nal 

piece of the bozeman uniform 

her situation is not unique as 

countless other students respond 

to the incessant call to conform 

is change cannot come soon 

enough 
in the past students literally died 
of embarrassment upon recogniz

ing how uncool their street clothes 

were in order to prevent this in the future 

montana hall has issued a list of the required 

items is list reportedly includes all the 

staples of bozeman life a varied assortment of 

annels an arcteryx jacket with a bridger pass 

conspicuously on display wool socks paired 

with birkenstocks etc incoming students 

are advised to leave their clothes in the forest 

overnight to get that woodsy smell
failure to comply with the bozeman 
uniform presents a serious problem as far as 
student morale is concerned e introduc

tion of new students in the fall is linked to a 

severe decrease in overall happiness of the up
per classmen a senior who wished to remain 

anonymous was quoted saying why did 
they freshman bother coming to 

bozeman if they dont even know 

the dierence between a black 

diamond and a 
north face 
other students have reported 
extreme discomfort when mak
ing eye contact with someone 

wearing a sweater without a name 

brand ese students are purpose
fully ostracizing themselves to the 
detriment of their peers e obvious disdain 

demonstrated by these selfproclaimed 

outcasts is interfering with the education 

process it becomes virtually impossible to 

focus on school work when one is occupied 

with the pressing issue of a stickerless water 

bottle because some students refuse to cover 

their bodies and material possessions with the 

brand logos that express common interests 

starting a conversation is out of the question 

e eort one would have to put into relating 
to these nonconformists is not equal to the 

emotional reward of a fullling friendship
complying with the bozeman uniform is 
the one tried and true method of climbing 

the msu social rock wall while it represents 

a signicant nancial commitment this is 

nothing compared to the supercial inter
actions one will share with fellow fashion

minded individuals aer being exposed 

to the wardrobes of the unaccommodating 

students as well as receiving numerous 

complaints from students the administration 

recently announced a majority of the 300 

million fundraiser would go to the college 

of student morale and fashion advice e 

dean stated this generous donation would 

go straight to rei discounts for fashionably 

inept students ey expect this new program 

to lead to better integration of freshmen as 

well as a more attractive cover photo for the 

new msu pamphlet 
not only does dressing 
according to code have practical benets but 

should one actually decide to venture into the 

wilderness the uniform doubles as functional 

exploring clothing one must be careful with 

this approach as evidence of too many adven
tures will incite wild jealousy and ultimately 

result in a lower social standing
while the blatant disregard for the dress 
code by select students is appalling it is 

possible that they simply dont understand 

the impact they have on others when they 

wear jeans without a annel 
not only is 
their behavior disrespectful to the culture on 

campus but it puts others in the uncomfort
able position of having to openly acknowl
edge their own superiority one junior put 

it this way im dont wanna say that they 

the dresscode violators are lowest on the 

totem pole but i denitely have more respect 

for myself than to show up looking like that 

its time for the community minded to take 

a stand and put down this agrant disregard 

for uniformity to rest once and for all every 

person has a role continue to look down on 

those who spend their money on food and 

rent rather than patagonias latest jackets 

one day soon they too will nally belong
president waldo cruzaldo was unavailable

she takes serious oense every time she passes

restoration project e ambitious 

plan was to kill all of the sh in the

restock it with genetically pure cut
throat trout rotenone a naturally 

occurring chemical kills sh and 

other oxygen breathing organisms

todd koel supervisor for the yellowstone 
fisheries and aquatics program explained 
that the national park service has an obliga
tion to restore the natural sheries wherever 

they can as the park service its our job to 

preserve the native species we have and restore 

the natural ecosystem rotenone is the only 

tool we have to fully restore cutthroat popula
tions koel said
despite signicant public opposition the 
team went ahead with the poisoning and 
restocking of the creek on aug 28 2015
restructured the way wildlife was managed 

before the national park service even existed 

park administration was stocking waters with 

sh many of these areas were originally sh
less including isolated alpine lakes tributaries 

that were blocked o due to natural obstacles 

or streams inuenced by hot springs and 

geothermal activity that were unhealthy for 

cutthroat
park superintendents entrusted the us 
fish commission to stock as many waters 

as they could fishing was viewed as both an 

enjoyable activity and as legitimate nourish
ment for employees and visitors alike when 

the army assumed control of the park around 

the turn of the century they furthered the 

progress of sustenance shing as a viable 

wildlife management philosophy species that 

fed on trout were viewed as competition to the 

needs of the people and oen were eliminated
in 1930 the park 
service constructed 

a hatchery on 

lake yellowstone 

e facility oper
ated by the us 

department of fish 

and wildlife was 

the largest supplier 

of wild cutthroat trout to planting projects 

throughout the country as early as 1936 the 

nps stopped planting sh in waters that did 

not already have them and opposed hatchery 

construction in the parks lakes and streams 

aer research showed that harvesting eggs 

was signicantly hindering natural reproduc
tion the practice was ended in the 50s by the 

year 1959 waters were no longer being stocked 

with sh
since then the nps has been evolving a 
landethic that revolves around maintaining 

the integrity of ecosystems and working to 

restore the land to the way it was before euro

american settlement 
altering agenda 
overview of park 
fisheries
according to the national park service 
maintenance of natural biotic associations or 

where possible restoration to preeuroameri
can conditions have emerged as primary goals 

for managing sh in yellowstone however 

this has not always been the case before the 

inuential leopold report in 1963 ethically 
two sides to the 
river
some anglers are hesitant to support the 
park services philosophical motivation aer 

all 48 percent of the waters in yellowstone 

did not have sh before the government began 

stocking them
richard durcot who operates a small hotel 
in cooke city has been shing the waters 

in and around yellowstone since 1990 and is 

strongly against the poisoning in soda butte 

creek
it is a great bureaucratic decision killing 
sh for nothing  a waste of money durcot 

expounded i love to see families come here to 

sh the streams children get so excited when 

they get a sh it is wonderful brookies are fun 
to catch and make 

a great meal i dont 

understand why they 

are poisoning the 

stream to get rid of 

them
others seemed 
to be more moder
ate in their opposition bob jacklin owner 

and operator of jacklins fly shop in west 

yellowstone feels there is not much that can 

be done to stop agencies from using rotenone 

in rivers and lakes
its not what i like but its happening 
jacklin explained everybody is on board 
from trout unlimited to the park service i 

just run a tackle shop here in west yellowstone 

who am i to say we should keep the brookies 

and rainbows
 e conict presents itself quite clearly 
some sherman see a signicant value in the 
nonnative trout and point out how well they 
are doing in the streams and rivers while the 

government is trying to restore the natural 

ecosystem and also prevent the cutthroat from 

being listed as an endangered species
ken frazer a biologist for montana fish 
wildlife and parks the lead agency in the 

soda butte project said that if cutthroat are 

listed as a threatened or endangered species 

we lose a lot of the control of how they can be 

managed
our goal is to not just protect these sh 
but to provide a recreational cutthroat shery 

for future generations frazer continued 

weve got projects going on all over the state 

ey are prioritized and we plan to do them 

one at a time
e soda butte project was of high impor
tance and urgency according to clint sestrich 

sheries biologist for the custergallatin 

national forest
soda butte is a high priority because it is in 
such a large interconnected basin also because 

it at a high elevation which is important as 

those areas are more resistant to the eects 

of climate change sestrich explained we 

wanted to eliminate risk that the nonnative 

trout would contaminate or even eliminate 

the core cutthroat population in the lamar
sestrich also noted the diculty many 
biologists and wildlife managers have reach
ing out to the public we usually arent the 
best pr people he chuckled but in all seri
ousness there is a lot of misunderstanding i 

feel like many people think we are on some 

sort of conquest to put cutthroat everywhere 

at is just not the case
ere has been signicant habitat 
improvement on soda butte sestrich 
continued in many ways everything that 
could be done to improve the habitat has 

been done e main thing that is limiting 

cutthroat is nonnative
 sh 
look at what happened in smith creek on 
the shields river sestich said it went from 
entirely cutthroat to all brook trout we have 

done samplings up there and havent found 

any cutthroat
e big picture
dwaine hackman who was born and 
raised in livingston has been shing the 

waters around cooke city for over 30 years 

hackman appreciates brook trout but under
stands why sh management has changed over 

time
fishing is better now than it was 30 years 
ago everybody killed sh back then one 

time i saw a man get stopped at the gate 

coming out of the park he had 55 cutthroats 

on a line i love the catch and release shing 

and barbless hooks you can catch big and 

beautiful sh even though nowadays there 
are more people shing than back then 

hackman remembered
hackman currently resides in bozeman 
but spends much of his summer around 

cooke city i was camped at the soda butte 

campground right outside of cooke when 

they were doing the creek poisoning i saw the 

whole process he said
it was a shame they 
had to kill so many sh 

but in the long run it 

may be well worth it 

hackman said look 

at some of the lakes they 

poisoned a while back 

there are monster cut
throat in them now 
hackman was con
cerned with the cost of 

the project and noted the equipment vehicles 

and manpower it seemed like an expensive 

project we didnt have a problem with the 

nonnative sh for me it seems like a lot of 

money spent in one direction when there are 

so many other ways it could have been used
frazer emphasized how montana fish 
wildlife and parks views the treatment as 

a savings rather than an expense we have 

spent about 18000 to 20000 on electro
shing soda butte each summer for about the 

past 20 years frazer said using rotenone 

we have to do two treatments and then we are 

done at represents a huge annual savings 

for our agency
sestrich further stressed the economic 
savings of the project we work for the 

public people are concerned about their tax 

dollars electrofishing is a huge cost eight 

days to do the whole rotenone treatment 

versus fourteen days every single year to 

electrofish when the logistics of equip
ment and manpower are factored in the 

rotenone is the most costeffective method 
we have to restore the native cutthroat 

population
rotenone is a commonly used chemical for 
removal of sh in lakes streams and rivers 

across the country some groups such as 

stopriverkillingorg
 take serious issue with the 
repeated poisoning of waters in the wilderness 

especially national parks and wildlife reserves
e nps notes 
how rotenone is 

epa approved and is 

neutralized with potas
sium permanganate 

we dilute it in parts 

per billion for treat
ment and neutralize 

it so it will harmlessly 

dissipate over time 

said koel ere is so 
much misinformation out there but if you 

read the literature and review the studies you 

can see that when used properly rotenone is 

a relatively safe and eective tool for native 

trout restoration
sarah ksicinski the park ranger who works 
at the northeast gate has noted mixed public 

opinions from visitors and locals alike ive 

noticed some people are totally against using 

rotenone but others are really supportive 

of restoring the cutthroat ksicinski has a 

background in natural resource conservation 

and feels the project was a necessary step for 

the trout e project has already been com
pleted the dicult part will be getting the 

information out there to educate people

bobcats roll to victory against east tennessee state
by a
ndrew waters
e montana state bobcats 
steamrolled to a 637 victory over 
east tennessee state scoring on six 

of the their rst seven drives east 

tennessee in its rst season since 

2003 has not won a game this sea
son two of their losses have come 

at the hands of division iii teams 

emory and henry and maryville 

college msu head coach rob 

ash insisted aer the game it 

wasnt about who we were playing 

it was about us we need to pay at
tention to detail and get better each 

and every day
 e bobcat oense displayed its 
scoring prowess with long passing 

plays leading to seven red zone 

scores junior dakota prukop 

completed 15 passes to 10 dier
ent receivers for 226 yards and 

three touchdowns sophomore 

justin paige led the wide receivers 

with two catches 92 yards and one 

touchdown running back junior 

chad 
newell also contributed with 
two of the ve rushing touchdowns 

for msu seven dierent rushers 

took part in 205 total yards  
east tennessee used two dier
ent quarterbacks throughout the 

game with 
nick sexton taking 
the majority of the snaps while 

the buccaneers were able to put 

together chunks of yards at a time 

they were only able to put together 

one scoring drive and it was in 

fourth quarter while certainly held 

in check the bucs showed signs of 

ability as they continually put pres

sure on the cats defense with 376 

total yards
on defense the cats have never 
overpowered a weaker opponent 

led by sophomore mac bignells 

10 tackles and redshirt freshman 

demonte kings interception the 

defense produced four turnovers 

e special teams also got involved 

in the blow out with two punt 

blocks and for the second week in 

a row the bobcats had a kick return 

for a touchdown
east tennessee certainly has a 
lot of potential growth in their 

future 
nineteen freshmen started 
the game against msu and east 
tennessee only has four players that 

are not freshman coach ash had 

praise for the young opponents 

what they are doing is building 

for the long term he said they 

could have gone out and gotten a 

lot of transfers but i respect what 

they are doing with having all fresh
man
while some might question 
the usefulness of playing such a 

mediocre team late in the season 

ash thought it was just what they 

needed by getting some key players 

healthy and rested and being able 

work out some other players reps 

ere was a clear dierence in size 

speed and ability between these 

two teams hopefully there are no 

adjustment issues when montana 

state faces one of the more stout 

defenses in the conference next 

weekend in 
north dakota ere 
are two or three issues in my mind 

we are going to have to x as we go 

into practice this week ash said 

hopefully the cats get those kinks 

worked out before the 12 pm

the womens volleyball team 
competed in two tough away 
games this week and although the 
cats lost both games they showed 

potential for the future
 e bobcats traveled to sacramento 
calif to take on the hornets of sacra
mento state on ursday oct 22 e 
hornets hold a 91 record at home and 
defended their home court with vigour 

e cats fell to the hornets 2515 in the 
rst set with the bobcats behind 93 
in the second set the hornets went on a 

90 run to make the score 183 before the 
bobcats could answer e cats lost the 
second set 257 e bobcats jumped to a 

31 lead in the third set but the hornets 
tied the score at four apiece before taking 
the lead with the cats trailing 1510 
sac state went on a commanding 152 
run to take a 2512 third set victory and 

dispatch the bobcats 30 i think the 

biggest thing that we took away from sac 
state is that we didnt play well and the 
key was to see how we responded against 
portland msu head coach jj riley 
said we felt like the team did a great job 

of moving on and refocusing for portland 
state
e bobcats then traveled to portland 
oreto take on the portland state vikings 

on saturday oct 24 e vikings jumped 
ahead early in the rst set 74 before the 

cats fought back and took the lead with 
the score at 1110 psu took the lead 
again with the score at 1817 but the 

bobcats were persistent with the vikings 
leading 2221 the cats scored four unan
swered points to take the rst set 2522 
e team came out in the rst set with 
great focus and determination riley said 
ey were dialed in with the plan and 
hitters tendencies which allowed us to get 

some blocks and then our passers did a 
great job which allowed our hitters to put 
up some great numbers
e second set proved to be similar to 
the rst with the lead changing several 

times throughout the set with the score 

tied at 2222 it was the vikings that 
scored the nal two points of the set to 
even the series at one apiece in the third 

set the score was tied 11 times and psu 

held a 2420 advantage before msu tied 

the score at 24 apiece e bobcats and 
vikings fought back and forth before 
portland state scored two unanswered 

points to take a 3432 victory in the third 

set e team showed great heart and 
ght in that third set to push it to extra 
points riley said  ey are working 

hard and battling so we need to celebrate 
that and keep fostering that ght in 
them
while the fourth and nal set wasnt 
as close as the other three the bobcats 

fought hard but came up short as the 

vikings outhit the cats 194 to 097 and 
took a 2519 victory to claim the match 
three sets to one montana state was led 

oensively by freshman 
natalie passeck 
who recorded a careerhigh 21 kills and 
senior 
natalee godfrey added 10 kills 
defensively sophomores kasey altman 
and dana vestman led in digs with 21 
and 18 respectively while godfrey also 
contributed with eight blocks 
e bobcats will travel to moscow 
idaho to take on the university of idaho 

vandals on ursday oct 29  against 
idaho we are looking to play our best 
volleyball play hard as a team and keep 

learning how to battle from start to n
ish riley said e game begins at 7 pm
womens basketball hungry 
for upcoming seasonby patrick allard
e msu womens basketball team went 
1515 overall last season with their ninth 
consecutive big sky conference postseason 
appearance e bobcats ended their big 

sky run with ve of six wins its lone loss 

coming in overtime at idaho state e bob
cats nished with an outstanding record 

winning eight of their last 12 games 
with the 201516 regular season fast 
approaching head coach tricia binford 

provided insight as to how the cats plan 
on improving this upcoming years perfor
mance we felt like we nished strong and 
we felt like we nished at a level of what 
its going to take to be a champion team 
this year areas for improvement are the 

teams weak ability to consistently control 
the rebound game and its ability to work 
together as a cohesive unit also aer last 

seasons conclusion the team lost some key 

senior players with valuable team members 
jackie elliott kali durham and ausha cole 
now graduated their contributions to the 

teams rebounding and scoring capabilities 
will have to be replaced 
despite this loss binford says that the 
majority of the roster is back and with re
turning players like senior jasmine hommes 

junior peyton ferris and sophomore alexa 
dawkins the team possess high versatility 

and an ability to run the oor hommes is a 

two time allbig sky conference post player 
and ferris was voted as a top reserve for the 
bigsky conference e combination of 

hommes ferris and dawkins give the cats 
one of the best front courts in the big sky 
binford also believes that returning players 

lindsay stockton and previously redshirted 

riley 
nodgaard will bring an element of 
surprise to the squad 
e guard play is going to be pretty 
underestimated this year binford said 
nodgaard is a transfer from south dakota 
with decent size and rebounding skill lling 

in some of the void at the three guard posi

tion when the cats graduated jackie elliott  
binford says that from a depth standpoint 
and experience standpoint the cats are 

geared up to put up more wins this year and 

travel further into the bigsky conference 
another new addition to the bob
cat program 
nba hall of famer john 
stockton will be the new assistant coach 

for the remainder of the 201516 season 

john stockton is regarded as one of the best 
point guards in 
nba history holding both 
records for most career steals and assists 
highly qualied for the position stockton 
has coached four players on the bobcat 
squad including his own daughter lindsay 
stockton and hommes are the bobcats 
team captains this 201516 season eyre a 

fantastic combination they complement each 

others leadership styles binford said lind
say is one of those kids that possess an aura 
of competitiveness  and sets the bar for her 
teammates every day in regards to hommes 

binford said shes consistently solid every 
day in practice shes fundamental she goes 
hard and she sets the bar in terms of focus  
e bobcats also hope to continue the 
tradition of strong classroom performance 
for six times in the past 10 years the cats 
have been rated in the top 12 academic 

teams for the 
ncaa division 1 level in 
the nation we establish a standard of 
priority right for the get go that when they 
athletes enroll here they create a value of 

habits and the three cs court classroom 
and community e lady bobcats have 
an exhibition game on wednesday 
nov 4 
against montana tech in the brick breeden

pace and set a powerful precedent for the 

rest of the season

e rst half of the mens rugby clubs h 
season is drawing to an end as they prepare to 
play western colorado state this saturday 

oct 31 e halloween match will be an 

exciting culmination to the growth and devel
opment of the young side this fall e team 

embraces their time on the eld no matter the 

weather  if you peeked outside during the 

unforgiving hail storm this past monday you 

would have seen both the mens and womens 

clubs enduring an hourandahalf of prepara
tion for the weekends matches 
once youve played in a match you under
stand the commitment it warrants  its not 

a game for everyone and were proud of the 

gentlemen we have and the culture were cre
ating mens captain matt asaro said e 

ladies have a great thing going as well its a 

strong group and theyre fun to watch
asaro went on to discuss the entertain
ment value of the game rugby ows much 

like a basketball or soccer game play is al
most nonstop and the more physical and t 

team usually wins rugby is americas fastest 

growing sport but the majority of bystand
ers still watch in disarray so when you nd 

yourself at the game this weekend remember 

a few basic things 
1 e ball can only be passed backwards
2 aer a tackle a ruck is formed by 

oense to preserve possession
3 a scrum a tightly packed group of 

players vying for the ball goes to the 

other team if you drop the ball for
ward which is known as a knockon
4 a lineout a means of restarting play 

to the other team occurs if you go out 

of bounds
5 no pads means smarter tackles  
similar to wrestling take downs
6 if a ruck is not formed the defender 

can simply take the ball
both clubs continue to work towards 
improvement as they will soon look to the 

spring for the second half of the season until 

then catch the men this saturday oct 31 at

  19by will hamelbobcat to the futureback to the future day has come and 
gone and many of its predictions failed to 
come true ere are no hover boards the 
cubs did not win the world series and 
military ame throwers did not become 
childhood toys that last one was in the

 however that has not stopped me 
from making my predictions of the future 

presented here is an imagining of what

because son in the future everything 
is run through your cell phone
 dad and son go to the concession stands 
for two hot dogs and drinks totaling 
7550 son

money

dad 
because son in the future everything 
costs a lot of money 
 dad and son reach their section
 son 
dad why arent we allowed to sit in

 because son in the future sitting is 
illegal  aer we cured cancer heart disease 
and teenage acne the leading cause of death 
became sitting

especially secondhand sitting

 pa 
and now ladies and gentlemen and

slacklife a critical look at the laziest outdoor sport
by parker webb
slacklining is no longer a fringe sport 
of the outdoor community it is practiced 
heavily by hipsters wannabes lazy climbers 

bikers and skiers for those who are unaware 

of what slacklining is think about tightrope 

walking it is practically the same thing 
minus the cool balancing stick ese low 
cost circus performers take a onetotwo

inch wide piece of webbing or cargo strap 

ratchet it tight between two trees and walk 

across it as simple as that seen everywhere 
throughout college campuses and public 
parks slacklining is by far the outdoor worlds 
laziest adventure ordeal and frankly a point
less one at that
 e majority of outdoor sports revolve 
around getting from point a to point b and 
not falling while doing so climbing you 

are going up with point a at the bottom of 
the climb and point b at the top hiking is 
all about going point to point skiing and 

biking the point a is at the top and point b 

is at the bottom our friendly neighborhood 

slackliners also go from point to point which 

is quite pointless to go from tree a to tree 
b slacklining you rst need to anchor the 
slackline to both trees which requires walk
ing to and from both trees on solid ground 

boom mission accomplished  point a and 
b reached yet once this pseudo tightrope 
gets rigged the person repeatedly falls at
tempting to cross a gap they had previously 

walked depending on the height of the line 
they fall far and hurt themselves making 

a fool of themselves in the process 
not a sunny fall day goes by where i see more than 
just leaves falling throughout campus
another major problem with this so called 
sport is its name lets dive deeper for a 
closer look slackline is almost completely in 

opposition to tightrope do these balancing 
circus acts truly lack enough creativity to 
give it a dierent name e lines arent even 
slack but rather as tight as the tightropes or 

even tighter e proof lies in what people 

attempt to do on them jumping around like 
a wild orangutan on a trampoline tricks 
ips and ops are all attempted on the slack
line which leads into another catastrophic 
drawback of this sport the potential to rack 
ones self fighting for your balance on top 

of this oneinch deathtrap a fall will almost 
certainly inict pain on the nether regions of 
ones body causing pain and hours of writh
ing on the ground next to the balancing trap 

from hell
if you are still reading this article at this 
point you are probably wondering who is 

this guy to call out this hipsters balancing 

act to that i must reluctantly respond that 

i parker webb am in fact one of these ail
ing equilibrists yes for the past eight years 
i have partaken in the activity of walking the 
slackline in fact it is what got me into the 
outdoor world and what got me into climb
ing i know rst hand of the pointlessness of 
its balancing in fact once while walking a 

line a hobo even approached me to tell me to 

get a job
slacklining can be pointless  walking 
from point a to point b falling and ail
ing  yet what isnt climbing you go up 

only to later come down skiing pow day aer 

day walking the line they are as capricious 

as going to certain classes while slacklin
ing diers greatly from many of the outdoor 
realms of activity they all hold one thing in 
common it isnt about the pointless repeti

tion and going from point a to point b its 

about the experience along the way

why i love game day grouse hunting around bozeman
by 
nick
 kasser
theres nothing like 
gameday at msu sure 
plenty of towns have foot
ball teams and plenty of 
them have football fans but 
no one can clear out a town 
and pack a stadium the way 
bozeman does 
people love game day for a lot 
of different reasons some peo
ple love the game some love the 
crowd their friends the noise 

some people love the food and 
the halftime show most girls 
love the football players and 

most guys love the cheerleaders 
i love game day because i get 
the woods almost all to myself 
everybody clears out of town to 
go the stadium so traffic is at a 

minimum as i drive down 
north 
seventh avenue on my way to 

go hunt in the bridgers i sip 

my soda water with my windows 

down and my radio up 
no bird 
dog in the back i rely on my 

feet and the occasional rock 

thrown into the bushes to scare 
up birds mostly my feet hunt
ing grouse in montana takes 
a lot of walking if you want 
to hunt grouse you have to go 
where the grouse are and where 

they are is high up in the moun
tains on ridgelines with pine 

trees and aspens and snowber
ries or in sagebrush bushes if 
youre lucky sometimes theyre 

in the road but mostly they are 

up high close to elk and deer 
and far away from people 
i drive up into the mountains 
and the road turns from pave
ment into dirt my dads old 

suburban isnt really made for 
roads like this but i go anyways 

because i need to i need air that 
smells like pine trees and animal 
fur it clears my head and its 

beautiful the human soul needs 
places that are left wild places 
that arent paved or made conve
nient yeti has a slogan for this 
there is a part of you that finds 
the comforts of home extremely 

uncomfortable amen
i pull up to the gate at the 
trailhead put the car in park 

and lace up my boots big 
heavy insulated high top dan
ners the old school american 
made ones theyre great for 

those early morning hunts when 
the sun isnt up and frost covers 
the grass maybe more impor
tantly i can stub my toe on 
rocks without breaking it huge 
bonus for a klutz like me
no other cars are here so i 
have the trail all to myself i 

shoulder my pack and my blaze 

orange vest and get to walking 
the trail winds up and around 
the side of the mountain and 

starts out covered in grass i am 
literally walking along the side 
of a mountain and there are 

two hawks circling at eye level 

next to me talk about majes

tic from here i can see all of 
bozeman 
the hunt goes well i flush 
a bird out of the bushes about 

fifteen minutes in and another 

one i track down through a 

thicket of pine trees next to a 

creek once i get back to the 

car i field dress the birds and 

put them in the cooler to give to 

my girlfriends family for dinner 

i get back into town right as the 

sun is starting to set and i hear 

that we won i pass the grocery 

store where everyone is stock
ing up on chips beer soda and 

pizza for the night yeah noth
ing like game day
i need air that smells like pine trees and animal fur it clears my head 
and its beautiful the human soul needs places that are left wild

  21banana couloir part 2 
electric boogaloo
by 
theodore
 grover
e cold settled around us and 
seeped into our bodies it penetrated 
the weak points in our exterior layers 

and slithered ever deeper toward 

our cores i could feel it biting at 

my extremities searching for feeble 

points in my build i started to skin 

faster but i could not shake the 

cold it followed me biding its time 

waiting to strike e thermometer 

in the car had read 15 degrees fahr
enheit when we started skinning 

that morning about an hour prior 

to dawn we continued on through 

the cold darkness until the sky began 

to lighten to the east my eyelashes 

were frosting over when the rst 

rays of the sun caught the ridge e 

rosy alpenglow trickled down the 
mountains until the entire bridger 

range burned ruby red e sun rose 

majestically over the bangtails chas

ing away the worst of the cold and 

forcing it into retreat i welcomed 

its warmth on my face and began 

to feel sensation return to my numb 

extremities looking back towards 

the bridgers i set my sights on ross 

peak it was payback time
my previous attempt to ski the 
banana couloir on ross peak 

was a miserable failure over the 

course of the tour both of my tour
ing bindings broke making for a 

reluctant retreat and a wretched 

journey back to the car a month 

had passed since that prior tour 

now equipped with a fresh pair of 
warrantied bindings i was back to 

nish what i started
e skin to the base of ross peak 
is deceivingly far it always seems 

to be just within reach but never is 

we didnt get lost or turned around 

like the time before but it still took 

a considerable amount of time to 

reach the couloir chiey because 

we had to break trail for most of 

the way ere was no established 

skin track aer the rst two miles 

so we blazed our own through the 

sparkling snow it was still cold but 

not nearly as chilly as it had been 

earlier that morning e tempera
ture had warmed up to balmy single 

digits a welcome reprieve from the 

mornings ghastly cold 
wed been skinning for a couple 
hours by the time we reached the 

base of the banana couloir break
ing trail for several miles had been 
taxing work more strenuous than 

we anticipated however the most 

demanding work was yet to come 

booting up the couloir proper 

close to 1500 vertical feet sepa
rated us from the top and the snow 

was deep we sunk up to our knees 

with almost every step we took it 

became apparent we were in for a 

goodoldwallowfest 
we took turns setting the boot 
pack as every step was a struggle 

plowing through the snow one step 

at a time brought us to the crux of 

the climb the nal pitch separat
ing us from the top gripped with 

summit fever we powered through 

the last couple hundred vertical feet 

and topped out on banana e sun 

shone down brightly on us as we re
laxed and caught our breath at the 
top e warm february sunshine 

felt welcoming on our frosty faces 

but also served as a reminder that 

the clock was ticking e banana 

couloir has a predominantly south
ern aspect meaning we didnt have 

the luxury of time it was time to 

get down before the solar radiation 

deteriorated the quality and stabil
ity of the snow
i clipped into my skis and looked 
down the line it was a beautiful 

winding gully blanketed with nice 

cold powder at that moment 

nothing else mattered except ski

ing 
not the temperature not our 
fatigued gures it was just me and 

the mountain and it was time for 

retribution aer all revenge is a 

dish best served cold and in this 

case powdery too

frightening and fun lms for halloween
by kaycee cro
nkwhats the scariest thing about october e 
midterm exams e people who insist upon 
making bad jokes about midterms being the 

scariest part of october well regardless the 

only things that should be scaring you are the 

ghosts the ghouls and maybe a few scary movies 

but what movies scream halloween well as

of recommendations to get you started
the classicshalloween 1978 lets get the obvious one 
out of the way rst shall we e rst installment 

of the nowexhausted franchise is quite good 

and its scare factor holds up surprisingly well 

following the tale of michael myers rst killing 

spree in the town of haddoneld this classic 

slasher ick is chilling enough to scare even the 
most cynical detractors of the horror genre
a 
nightmare on elm street 1984 a 
unique premise and plenty of genuine chills have 

secured a 
nightmare on elm street a place in 
the horror movie hall of fame one of the most 

iconic killers in all of lm freddy krueger mur
ders his victims in their dreams as the hunted at
tempt to gure out what is going on he wastes no 

time in dispatching them in a rather grisly fashion
its the great pumpkin charlie brown 
1966 not every halloween mustsee needs to 
be scary catch up with the peanuts gang and 

their woebegone poster boy charlie brown 

during a rather eventful halloween night team 

great pumpkin forever

both outlandish and hilarious
detention 2011 a crazed serial killer 
going by the name cinderhella is terrorizing 

a local high school but thats only the tip of the 

iceberg in this utterly insane horror com
edy honestly the level of insanity cannot be

 23halloween fun a guide to bdsmas we prepare to enter the world 
of sweet treats disguises and dark
ness that is oered by halloween we 
are reminded of our fantasies while 
some may take on the skin tight 
black cat costume or the tiny school
girl outt for fun others will take 
them on as pleasures and personali
ties for sex halloween began as a 
way to ward o dark creatures of the 
night this week we have conversa
tion of what many see as a darker 
topic bondage and discipline 
dominance and submission sadism 

and masochism bdsm
bondage is easily enough dened 
as being tied with such materials as 
rope silk and leather but may also 
include the idea of being bound to 
someone whether the relationship is 

intimate or merely sexual discipline 
is training someone to obey certain 
rules through a system of punish
ment and reward dominance and 

submission imply a relationship 

of control where one person is in 
charge of another who is subservi
ent to them is relationship may 
be set in stone or partner may 
switch roles according to the day or 

mood sadism is to derive pleasure 
from inicting pain or humiliation 
upon others masochism is the part
ner to this deriving pleasure from 
ones own pain and humiliation 
ese various aspects of bdsm may 
include such extreme items as whips 
canes and ball gags or such common 
sexual paraphernalia as blindfolds 

and fuzzy handcus
bdsm relationships are oen 
compared to violent and abusive 
relationships but there is a line 
between the two which can be 

dened simply as consent e boze
man civitas society a social and 

educational group denes bdsm as 
the use of bodily sensations to elicit 
pleasure and as a form of consen
sual power exchange where both 
participants are empowered 
when participating in bdsm 
partners must establish a set of rules 

and agreements concerning the ac
tivities to follow is includes com
ing up with a safe word which will 

allow the partners to know when it 
is okay to continue and when they 

should stop the activity bdsm 
also creates builds and heavily relies 
upon the trust between partners 
and uses this trust to fulll the 
desires of each partner in a safe envi

ronment is trust is built through 
communication about everything 
from what sexually pleases each 
partner to the emotions experienced 
during each sexual act e rules 

limits and boundaries established 
must be respected and obeyed at all 
times for the sake of the comfort of 

each participant 
abuse on the other hand is 
when the actions are not consented 
to limits are not established and 
boundaries are ignored leading 
to physical mental and emotional 

damage and endangerment while 
bdsm serves to empower partners 
abuse serves to take away any and 
all power from a partner by force 
ere is no safe word and trust is 

destroyed communicate with your 
partner about what is and is not 
okay consent and communication 
make up the road to a happy and 
healthy life 
bozeman civitas society maintains 
a communication information educa
tion and support network for members 

of the bdsm community and sup
ports the right of all adults to engage 

in safe sane and consensual sexual 
expression for more information

nmission impossible  rogue nation
e mission impossible movies some
how keep impressing me right when the 
franchise started to get dry they released 

ghost protocol and the addition of simon 

pegg and jeremy renner added a fresh feel 
to the series it made ghost protocol my 
favorite mission impossible movie yet
well rogue 
nation outdoes all of the 
predecessors
e team is back at it again when senate 
member alan hunley alec baldwin gets 

the imf disbanded things start to go awry 

however that doesnt stop ethan tom 
cruise from continuing to hunt e syndi
cate a rogue organization xated on ong 
the imf he gets the team back together 
along with some unlikely allies in order to 
take down the syndicate
rogue 
nation much like its predeces
sors never stops delivering the action it 

brings the crazy amount of stunts that the 
mission impossible series is known for and 
somehow makes them even better you will 

be on the edge of your seat the entire movie 

eagerly awaiting what will happen next
antmane abundance of superhero movies that 
have been released in the past ve years is 
getting absurd it seems like there are at least 

four or ve coming out every year i know 

many people who are getting burnt out on 

superhero movies myself included most of 

these movies tend to be origin stories which 
involve explaining how the hero got their 
powers ey are all the same e hero starts 
o as a nobody something happens so he 
or she gets powers a villain happens to pop 
up shortly aer almost like they planned 

for that or something hero ghts villain 
hero loses hero trains hero wins everyone 
is happy its become predictable  the same 

goes for antman
when catburglar scott lang paul rudd 
stumbles upon a super suit he gets the power 

to shrink down you know to the size of an 

ant he then meets the maker of the suit 
hank pym michael douglas who tells 
scott that he must use the suit to thwart his 

old protege darren cross corey stoll who 

plans to replicate the suit to use it for evil 
en the rest writes itself
antman wasnt unwatchable by any 
means e superhero movie genre is simply 
played out to the point where new entries are 
redundant if youre a huge superhero bu 
youll probably enjoy it but dont expect any
thing dierent from the 30 other superhero 

movies that have been released recently  
the man from uncl
eif e man from u
ncle feels 
familiar dont worry  it should e lm 
is a wellmade comedic sendup of serious spy 
movies featuring a tuxedoed seducer a la the 
james bond franchise parodying the genre 
is hardly a new idea  the lm is based on a 
tv series from the 60s which was cowritten 

by ian fleming the creator of james bond 
aer a decade of penning the suave spy 
fleming was ready to begin parodying his 

earlier creation
e lm takes place at the height of the 
cold war when henry cavill man of steel 

and armie hammer e social 
network 
agents from opposite sides of berlins wall 
are forced to work together to stop elizabeth 
debicki e great gatsby from building 

a nuclear weapon cavill and hammer are 

also both trying to get alicia vikander ex 
machina to share her fathers secret research 
with their side but not the others
nothing here is particularly new but that 
doesnt stop it from being a fun ride true 
lies arnold schwarzeneggers best johnny 
english and a hundred others have spoofed 
james bond before lethal weapon and 
rush hour have forced mismatched partners 

to work together before and nearly every sit
com has exploited sexual tension for comedic 

hijinks but e man from u
ncle takes 

the best of everything directed by the stellar 

guy ritchie snatch sherlock holmes 
this is a great way to kill a few hours

the clothes dont make the man or woman
by 
keega
n g
rady
at a dance you often feel bass 
rather than hear it on satur
day night in the middle of the sub 
ballroom colored lights were flash
ing everywhere and the bass was 

shaking the audiences chests 
  and on stage on stage the night was just be
ginning  anita tatas strode out dressed in a 
tight black dress shnet stockings and a huge 
beehive hairdo and the crowd went wild
for the uninitiated a drag show is a unique 
experience  to say the least is one began 
with a bang and never slowed down e 

music was hugely varied  with numbers 
from chicago to the weather girls to bon
nie tyler as varied as the music were the cos
tumes ueens appeared in everything from 
iridescent oorlength dresses to white tutus 
kings were in black fedoras and leather jack
ets jeans and baseball caps many performers 
sparkled in the stage lights some were in 
ashy custom clothes but many performers 

dressed quite simply e dances ranged from 
impromptu numbers involving audience 
members to highly choreographed dances 

one surprise performance stole the audi
ences hearts  a king ryder strong dragged 
his lady 
natascha uimby one of the show 
organizers up on stage and serenaded her 

with just the way you are
and for many of the performers it isnt about 
whats done on stage i love making people smile 

and laugh said bozeman queen electra sexton 
my personal objective is to make people forget 
about whats going on in their own personal life 

and have fun with the experience 
e vibes from the crowd were fantastic 
 cheering and whistles accompanied every 
performance and many members of the crowd 
tipped the performers while they danced for 

drag queen fawn ovamae the best part of 
doing a drag show is the personal benet i 
love the feeling i get being on stage she said 

when the crowd cheers there is this visceral 
i did a good job moment
but the benets of a show arent limited to 
inside the sub ballroom to raise funds for 
the event msus ueer straight alliance 

qsa sold tshirts proclaiming love=love 
posters advertising the dance were hung all 
over campus raising general public aware
ness e show raised money for qsa which 
in turn provides support and outreach for 
lgbtq community members and as well 

as simply making qsa more visible the drag 
show may even change individual notions 
about the lgbtq community sonja benton 
one of the event organizers described bringing 
selfidentifying straight female friends to 
dances and having them comment on how 
hot the drag kings are while this doesnt 
change their sexuality it does make them real
ize how uid both gender and sexuality are 

which isnt something thats found elsewhere 

very oen benton said
our society can oen condemn things it 
does not understand living in a world gov
erned by traditional values it can be easy to 
write o those who are not like us a drag 
show is a movement against making everyone 
the same  it is a wild and passionate expres
sion of all of oneself 
when asked what heterosexual students 
can do to be more supportive qsa presi
dent alex paterson said be an ally  speak 
out against statements and jokes that attack 
lgbtq people and most importantly 

celebrate the accomplishments and wonders 
of all lgbtq students
aer the last performer chairs were 
enthusiastically stacked away and the oor 

cleared e dance began under the pulsing 
rainbow lights it was occasionally dicult to 
discern who was what gender but as the mob 
of people began to jump and jive congregat
ing to the center of the oor one thing slowly 

became clear  it didnt matter just for a 
moment everyone was 100 percent human

procrastinator celebrates 40th anniversary of 
rocky horror
by julia
na hart
this year marks the 40th anniversary of 
the rocky horror picture show this 
cult classic has become a tradition and even 
a rite of passage since its initial failure in 
1975 rocky horror was considered one of 
the worst failures of cinematic history and 
was only revived by the dedication of avid 
fans with 40 years under its belt rocky 
horror is now the longest running movie 
in history the procrastinator theatre has 

been running rocky horror every hallow
een for years
e rocky horror picture show is an ec
centric parody of both sci and horror mov
ies its a musical featuring a 50sstyle vibe 
about a young recently engaged couple who 
become stranded with dr frank 
n furter a 

mad scientist transvestite and his rather dull 

but hunky creation rocky when watching 

it you wont be screaming in terror but will 

most likely scream with laughter
david iede who runs the procrastinator 
said that the best part of going to rocky horror 

is having a blast and dressing up at least half of 

the audience was dressed up as characters from 

the lm and some were dressed in halloween 

costumes although he does admit that he 

believes the best audience is when there is a mix 

of casual watchers and passionate dressedup 

fans one of the best parts of rocky horror is 
that it is actually a requirement that you make a 

mess  people are encouraged to throw toast 

shoot water guns throw rice and yell replies and 
insults at the screen
is obviously creates quite the mess 
iede says it takes the lm crew nearly two 

hours aer every show to clean up because of 
all the rice even with the cleanup required he 
says it is still worth it to put the show on year 
aer year iede said his favorite part of put
ting on rocky horror is watching everyone 
take to the oor to dance the time warp 

he also enjoys looking out over the audience 

when things get thrown and of course the 

preshow is always fun
e preshow itself is something worth 
seeing iede spends a fair bit of time work
ing to make the preshow fun and interesting 

he will oen tell stories however he does 

say that those stories are entirely for comedic 

value  he does not yet need viagra as many 

patrons of this years shows might believe
e preshow also consists of two games 
that tend to make people blush one game is 

used to baptize the rocky horror virgins 

those who have never seen or been to rocky 

horror before and the other is to play 

with the veterans who chose to dress up as 

characters from the show of course as an 

audience member even a virgin you always 

have the choice whether or not you wish to 

participate in these games but still as a virgin 
be warned if you do participate you will do a 
fair amount of blushing
e procrastinators showing of the rocky 
horror picture show has been a fundraiser 
for as long as iede can remember he said 
it was his choice to continue making it a fun
draiser and he did so gladly e fundraiser 

besides helping patrons of the show donate 

food to the gallatin valley food bank lets 

people see the show without paying cash  
an important note because rocky horror is 

still a somewhat controversial and admittedly 
very strange is way iede says the worst 
thing that will come of someone not liking 
the show or deciding it isnt their thing is that 
theyve donated some food to people in need 

last year rocky horror brought in about 

500 pounds of food and this year is estimated 

to have brought in at least as much if not 

more

a professor of philosophy in the college 
of letters and science gregg valeriano has 
been challenging students on their own 
beliefs since he began teaching at msu in 
2002 from his perspective examining and 
answering questions such as why am i 

here and what is my purpose in life are 
some of the most important things humans 

can do
philosophers like pascal or heidigger 
thought that the ultimate philosophical 

question is why is there something rather 
than nothing  and that sounds really ab
stract and when you read martin heidigger 
it is  but if you pare it down you start to 
ask why am i here as opposed to not i 

could easily have not been here valeriano 
said so why am i here how did i get here 

what is my purpose in life and how do i 
know this ose are some of those ques
tions we should all be asking continually 
and constantly trying to nd more complete 
or nuanced answers to very basic but very 
important i think
a native of new jersey valeriano became 
interested in philosophy as an undergrad 
through of one of his professors a teacher 
of history and religion who challenged his 
beliefs and encouraged him to examine 
why he believed what he believed aer he 
graduated from princeton eological semi
nary in 1997 valeriano spent several years 
teaching in switzerland in 2002 and moved 
to montana to begin working at msu
valeriano spoke on his home state and 
move across the nation overall i dont miss 
new jersey he said but new york city is 
a pretty cool place growing up i used to go 
to hockey football and baseball games and 
all that kind of stu or to the art museum or 
carnegie hall so i miss that aspect but not 
enoughoverall i dont want to go back
valeriano has an active christian faith  
he is an elder at bozemans trinity pres

byterian church  which has inuenced 
his studies of theology and his career in 

philosophy
i think a lot of people have this idea that 
christians or people who are religious just 
take things on faith and a lot of people 
do and i think thats a shame i think that 
if you understand christianity correctly it 
actually teaches you to think very critically 
about what you believe and why you believe 

it valeriano said
valeriano related his approach to phi
losophy to that of the inuential thirteenth 

century philosopher and catholic priest 
omas aquinas christians believe that 
we are all made in the image of god and 
that means that we are able to know truth 
goodness and beauty so aquinas was on 
the lookout for that wherever it might be 
found so i try to do the same thing wher
ever there is truth goodness and beauty i 

want to nd it and if i dont have it or if 

i have a mistaken belief about that i want 

to correct that and you can only do that in 

the context of dierent opinions or beliefs
in his capacity as a teacher valeriano rare
ly states his beliefs in class because he wants 
students to be able to trust his presentation 
of dierent viewpoints as unbiased none 

of us are objective  i need to present other 

points of view in a loving and caring way 

because they who hold dierent views are 

my neighbors
last april valeriano had the opportunity 
to moderate the christianity and the tooth 
fairy event a discussion between john len
nox an oxford professor and christian and 
don demetriades an atheist colleague and 
friend of valeriano e veritas forum which 
organized the event contacted valeriano to be 
the moderator for the discussion e student 

turnout for the event impressed valeriano i 
think it reected well on msu and this com
munity that students really are interested in 
these kinds of questions he said
e veritas forum has recently contacted 
valeriano about moderating another event 
this coming january an oer which he plans 
to accept exact details of the event have not 
been released yet
when considering his favorite aspect of 
his job valeriano said it was the opportu
nity to teach students and to learn new 

things in turn he described the relationship 
between students and teachers as a gi 
exchange a notion he acquired from one of 

his colleagues
heres what bums me out the most a stu
dent in the back row whos had their comput
er open and hasnt looked up for 45 minutes 

in a 50 minute lecture because theyre looking 

at something else on the screen  theyre not 
realizing what we are talking about here is 

actually very important and so in that sense 
they dont engage in this gi exchange they 
dont accept the gi and they dont want to 
reciprocate valeriano said
he continued saying its a total cliche 
but as teacher you learn as well as the stu
dents in a classroom ats what i love about 

teaching i am constantly challenged and its 

just a great thingyoure trying to give them 
something and when the students respond 

theyre giving back and you receive some
thing ats what interests me in teaching

pluto and beyond space historian speaks at mor
by 
ross
 sellers
andrew chaikin a world
renowned space historian and 
journalist gave a talk about space 

exploration and particularly 
the most recent development of 
nasas voyage to pluto on mon
day nov 2  at the museum of the 
rockies his discussion reminded 
the general audience why humans 

have been enthralled with the vast 
enormity surrounding earth ever 
since they have been conscious and 
cognitive beings for those beyond 
the general audience his discussion 
provided an indepth insight into 
the realm of space
 when 630 pm hit so did the 
early arrivals it was a cold and rainy 

night with 

the promise 

of snow 
ere were 
no stars as 
the sky was 
blanched by a 

cover of thick 
cloud people 
congregated 

indoors  in 

relief of the 
rain  to discuss the immense darkness 
and the secrets yet undiscovered 

terms like neutronium mechanics 
astrophysics and quantum physics 
echoed throughout the auditorium as 
people found their seats
at 7 pm chaikin once a self 
described young spacestruck ve 

year old found his place at the po
dium to a round of applause from 
the audience he began his talk 
stating im going to take you on 
a little trip and for the next hour 

the trip was set to full throttle
chaikin is one of the scientists 
on the new horizons team an 

exploratory mission lead by alan 
stern the chief scientist who rst 
conceived of the mission 25 years 
ago chaikin is a journalist for the 
team and his capacity and passion 

for space exploration made his talk 
easy to follow even for those not 
immersed in science
e new horizons spacecra is 
one of the intriguing aspects of the 

mission it is the size of a grand 
piano and weighs 1100 pounds 
 pretty light for a spacecra 
when it was launched on january 
19 2006 it le the earth going 
faster than any manmade object 
has ever le earth 36000 miles per 
hour
chaikin gave perspective to 
the audience saying it took the 
apollo astronauts  when they 
went to the moon  about three 
days to get from the earth to the 
moon new horizons crossed the 

orbit of the moon nine hours aer 
leaving earth and within a year it 
was ying past jupiter nine and 

a half years later new horizons 
nally passed pluto
when the cra reached pluto on 
july 14 2015 man nally explored 
the farthest planet in the solar 
system is date is also signicant 
because ex
actly 50 years 
prior an
other robotic 

explorer ew 
by mars and 
took the very 
rst closeup 
pictures 
of another 
planet
what researchers found on the 
surface of pluto was of course sur
prising ey found frozen plains 

frozenwater mountains and even 

came up with technical terms 
like reddishbrown stu to 
describe the surface of some parts 
of pluto ey speculate that some 
parts of pluto are still forming 

but its very early in the discovery 
process so a lot is still unknown 
about pluto
chaikin ended the discussion 
stating the fact that pluto is not 

alone and there may be over 

1000 planets all with disjointed 
orbits in the kuiper belt an 
expanse of thousands of icy worlds 
beyond neptune
ere will be more to come from 
new horizons as it should take 

about a year to get all the images 

and information about pluto 
while the spacecra travels further 

into the abyss of space for more 
informationon the current progress 

of new horizons go to

tons outstanding physics research important 

applications of physics leadership in or service 
to physics or signicant contributions to phys
ics education landed him a spot in this elite 

group of physicists 
an msu faculty member since 1995 
minton worked at nasas jet propulsion 

laboratory focusing on materials for space
cra before going into academia
mintons research studies atomic and 
molecular collisions to learn more about how 

materials used in spacecra react in spaces 

extreme environment finding out more about 

how materials interact at a molecular level helps 
researchers learn what materials work best for 
space applications according to minton he 

said e goal is to understand the reactivity so 
we can design materials that are more durable in 
space  we direct beams of atoms or molecules 

at surfaces and observe how they or their reac
tion products scatter from the surface
minton said that researching at msu has 
been refreshing due to his resultsbased work 
at the jet propulsion laboratory at msu 
minton is able to look deeper into the ques

when talking about how society 
views sexual assaults their per
petrators and most importantly the 

victims on college campuses the issues 

created by title ix must be addressed 

title ix a federal law that was 

instituted to prevent sexual 

discrimination in any federally

funded education program has 

been working hard to address 

the epidemic of sexual assaults 

on college campuses and pro
tecting the victim is a big part 

of what they do
title ixs activism surround
ing sexual assault survivors has added 

more problems from a legal standpoint 

their investigations are limited to 60 

days according to federal mandate actual 

criminal cases on rapes can take years so 

it is incredibly important that campuses 

have the ability to take immediate action 

in order to protect students these pro
ceedings are extremely effective on paper 

but when put into practice they create 
more complex issues and even though 

title ix themselves cant pass sanctions 

school administrations almost always fol
low title ixs advice in fear of losing the 

funding granted by the program
since title ix hearings use the 
preponderance of evidence as 

a burden of proof as opposed 

to the beyond a reasonable 

doubt burden of proof used in 

prosecuting criminal cases they 

can better handle rape cases 

which often have little physical 

evidence beyond a forensic exam 

commonly referred to as a rape 
kit something that lawyers have discred
ited before by convincing juries that the 

evidence presented in them can be caused 

by consensual sex these kangaroo courts 

also do not allow for legal representation 

again in an effort to protect the victim by 

not making it about whose lawyer is better 

this is due to the unfortunate he said she 

said nature of rape cases which is easy for 

a skilled lawyer to discredit in court
this creates a huge problem in how 
society views these cases because these 

proceedings are so fast and the deci

sion of the court is often reactionary as 

opposed to long and nuanced the public 

follows suit by responding in a reaction
ary way title ix leads 

by example in this 

regard and they can 

actually end up hurting 

the victim or the vic

tims legal case when 

an accused perpetrator 

gets expelled by the 

school immediately 

following a title ix 

investigation people 

will say hes a good 

guy and he doesnt deserve this an ex
tremely problematic statement when one 

considers again the fact that most rapes 

are by nonstrangers friends of a victim 

can very well be friends with the perpe
trator however a longer or maybe more 

public trial would make people question 
do i agree with all of this information 

before me
again all these issues end up coming 
back to us as a public and how knowl
edgeable we are on them as it stands 

sex education in america is a d+ at 
best so the general 

populations knowl
edge on this issue is 

little beyond rape is 

bad title ixs cur
rent way of handling 

these cases wouldnt 

stir up issues if we 

were all highly edu
cated on rape and its 

effects even though it 

would be great if every 
person in america was well versed in the 

psychology of it it is not where we are 

at as of right now the government has 

to make more of an effort to reform the 

current system to something that will 

protect the victims socially and not just 

on paper

shooting for safety msu active shooter protocol not up to par
president waded cruzado recently 
organized a public forum in response 
to roseburg oregons umpqua com
munity college shooting in this forum 

the montana state police department 

provided a short video titled run hide 

fight in which a system of 

action was detailed for victims 

of a shooting to follow the 

systems process is structured 

around three responsive actions 

in a prioritized order running 

away from the situation hiding 

from the shooter and fighting 

the shooter
while it is important to 
establish a plan to respond to any harmful 

event the run hide fight system may 

not be an effective approach for a campus 

setting the video portrayed a shoot
ing scenario within an office building 

where system may be most effective with 

a small number of people to evacuate 

running may provide a good opportunity 

for survival however when applying an 

officesetting evacuation and survival plan 

to a university one must compare the 

outcomes having an organization with 

a dozen or so employees per floor evacu
ate is more of a pragmatic approach than 

having a multitude of classrooms with 40 

to 60 students apiece chaotically flood 

hallways 
furthermore our single doorways 
are not models of rapid egress imagine 

attempting to rapidly evacuate a lec

ture hall of some two hundred or more 

students now imagine the lecture group 

following the run components encour
age others to flee with you rule orderly 

evacuation is not easily imaginable when 

crowds of students are shouting at each 

other to escape through limited few exits 

when students leave a classroom they 

are leaving behind a defensive position 

they leave an area of safety to run into 

potential killzones which may be the 

very door from which they are attempt
ing to escape by leaving a classroom that 

could easily be secured students would 

be bringing themselves as victims to the 

shooter rather than forcing the shooter 

to look for potential victims as response 

time by the msu police department 

should be relatively quick the immediate 

goal would be to have the shooter spend 

as much time as possible struggling to 

find or access victims besides a bottle
neck like a doorway could just as well 

be deemed a target for a shooter a mass 

of students pushing each other out a 

door one by one into the shooters sights 
would be like penguins pushing each 

other into orca infested waters
a more effective methodology would 
be the run hide fight system without 

the run this would involve hiding and 

securing where you most likely already 
are a classroom sound famil
iar that may be because it is a 

practice most of us have already 

experienced at my highschool 

it was referred to as a lockdown 

this ensures there is no disor
derly exodus the video suggests 

that once the occupants of the 

building being attacked have 

escaped they should find a place 
to hide outside there are few outdoor lo
cations that can provide refuge to several 

dozen students add to that the possibil
ity of the shooter targeting students from 

a high vantage point on campus and the 

situation becomes catastrophic if the end 

goal is to hide it might as well be within 

the classroom
in addition to hiding students and 
staff can prepare the fight aspect of the 
system while securing the classrooms ac

cording to run hide fight everyone 

should arm themselves in preparation to 

fight the shooter should the shooter come 

within the vicinity of those hiding that 

is a great feature to the system especially 

for a college campus scenario class

rooms backpacks pockets any number 

of personal effects or university property 

could be present and available to use as a 

means of defense should a shooter man
age to get into a secured classroom they 

would find themselves confronted with 

dozens of armed students
a lockdown and fight system should 
be our campus policy all university staff 

should be trained to take control and 

manage a campuswide lockdown every 

medium available should be used to make 

the situation known in the event of a 

campus shooting the msu alert system 

would notify staff and students addi

tionally there should be another public 

address system such as loudspeakers 

that would warn students of a shoot
ing scenario at that point classrooms 
should be secured by their occupants 

doors would be locked and barricaded 

and students should contact emergency 

services all under the guidance of the 

classrooms professor or similar univer
sity staff students outside of classrooms 

should seek refuge wherever possible 

facilities like the strand union building 

should be controlled by trained univer
sity staff 
as there are students who have never 
participated in a lockdown procedure 

there should be drills conducted each se
mester lockdown drills would not only 

provide insight into the strengths and 

weaknesses of the procedure but would 

also familiarize all the participants of 

the system with its operation any aspect 

of a plan can be well memorized but 

without rehearsal applying a concept in 

a lifethreatening situation is not entirely 

feasible muscle memory is a safer bet 

over knowledge when bullets start flying 

with a student body size larger than 

15000 there should be no reason to tell 

everyone to run

broing pains a guide to identication and avoidance
increased enrollment has 
brought a lot of changes to 
montana state university among 

those changes is a recent influx 

of what has become known as the 
bro populace 
a bro is a socioculturally 
constructed term referring to 

any type of caucasian college

aged male fitting one of three 

stereotypes extreme moderate 

and fluid
an extreme bro by definition 
is a male university student of 

the uppermiddle class to lowerupper 

class typically belonging to a fraternity 

these bros tend to have a descriptive 

vocabulary limited to words such as epic 

and extreme hence the title extreme 

bro generally marked by their distinct 

attire an extreme bro is easily identifiable 

from the head down the appearance of 

an extreme bro is marked by a flatbilled 

cap turned backwards with white oakley 

brand sunglasses fixed to the bill so that 
no aspect of the apparel meets its purpose 

of shading the eyes a spiking hair gel is 

used to create the cliffside cut where 

only the bangs stand straight up a hemp 

necklace is tightly worn as is a collar

popped ralph lauren polo shirt which 
is normally tight fitting to give 

their unathletic body a muscular 

appearance this is often an 

unsuccessful means of mask
ing their moobs or manboobs 

boat shoes match swim trunks 

while birkenstock sandals match 

plaid shorts
the moderate bro sits in 
the lower end of the middle 
class spectrum a common trait of the 

moderate bro is interrupting a sentence 

to oneup a story usually one involving 

heavy drinking or weightlifting they are 

often marked by tribal tatoos and tapout 

brand apparel moderate bros frequent 

gyms and the surroundings of reflective 

surfaces in which they can study their 

reflections a signature workout routine 

of the moderate bro is occupying as much 

space as possible to restrict others from its 
use which involves moving benches under 

squat racks and texting
the fluid bro is one that occasionally 
fits the role of bro be it intentionally or 

inadvertently as often is the case with as

similation the common 

male student when 

exposed to high levels 

of bro for extended pe
riods of time may find 

themselves sharing bro 

characteristics a fluid 

bro will at times address 

their friends as bro 

bruh broseph or 

any other variation due 

to repeatedly hearing 

the term this is usually 

followed by frustration
universal characteris
tics of bros include their sports interests 

which range from ultimate frisbee to 

lacrosse some of their more prominent 

communal contributions are seen in 

suburban house parties often taking form 

in their demonstration of high beerpong 

skill a refined taste for alcohol allows 
them to make the most efficient use of 

vented beer cans they are very aware of 

their political affiliations though they are 

often unable to provide validity to any po
litical statement bros generally prioritize 
the objectification of 

women alcohol en
ergy drinks and fantasy 

football over higher 

education as it is usu
ally parentfunded 
bros are some of the 
largest contributors to 

air pollution in place of 

showers most bros will 

douse themselves in axe 

or old spice body sprays 

ese odors are most 

oen associated with 

loud music roaring from 
parentpurchased lied vehicles as both 

sound and smell escape from open windows
bros are pretty much unavoidable 
however knowing what to look for can 

aid in escaping the fluid bro trap now 

provided with that knowledge you can 

help prevent bro assimilation

why i decided to serve as faculty advisor 
for students for concealed carry
letter
 to
 the
 editor
editori
al 
cartoon
my name is kevin kervick and i am an 
instructor and walk in academic advisor on 
campus i am surrounded by an amazing team 
of creative and brilliant educators ey are 

pros in every way i feel blessed to have an op
portunity to work with them at msu i love 

my job is is a great university
 i have a 27 year career as a marriage and 
family therapist in four states but on a college 

campus i am small potatoes i am just a guy try
ing to make a living doing some things i enjoy i 
try not to take myself too seriously but i do my 
best to live my values and act with integrity 
about 20 years ago while in my family 
therapy training program in philadelphia 

i began to reject some of the progressive 
political notions that were enshrined in our 
curriculum while i considered myself a le 

of center liberal i found myself thinking that 
a lot of the gender feminist and social justice 
assumptions of my professors seemed well 
ridiculous ey seemed to be based more on 
fantasy and political wish lists than common 

sense i found the assumptions coming from 
philosophy evolutionary psychology and 
the emerging mens movement to make more 
sense but i was afraid to speak out because i 
could tell there was a powerful groupthink 
around the dominant liberal worldview and 
i did not want to come across as a heretic 
at began my slow march to conservatism 
a journey that has continued for 23 years 

today i like to think of myself as a conserva
tive populist or a conservative communitarian 

i enjoy mentoring young people that share my 
values because i believe they are neglected 
and there are growing calls to lessen political 

groupthink at universities
when i read about students for concealed 
carry in the bozeman daily chronicle i was 

struck by the fact that this was a fairly large 
group that had already been able to amass over 
ten members required to be a formal activities 
group at msu and it had a passionate and 
very bright student organizer e group had a 
great facebook page and it was connected to an 
existing national organization e organizer 

was very clear about the goals of the group and 
there was an action plan in the works ere 
were veterans involved in the group essentially 
these are the characteristics we would want 
every student action group to have
e only thing this group lacked was a 
faculty adviser at struck me as wrong e 
organizer shared that he had consulted with 
several potential advisers who each told him 

they quietly supported the concealed carry 
cause but they were worried about the eect 
their advising might have on their academic 

careers at struck me as an injustice ese 
students should have the same access to 

faculty resources as all of the other students 
and groups on campus even if their missions 
are controversial to some people heck there 

are already a lot of controversial groups on 
campus that may have ocenter missions and 
goals but they have faculty support con
cealed carry is a hot issue at universities all 

over the country and it is an issue that matters 

to a lot of people several schools in gun 
friendly states already have concealed carry 

provisions at their state universities
consequently aer a lot of thought and 
realistic counsel with campus leaders i have 

decided to do it if for no other reason these 
guys need someone to help them my parents 
and my religion taught me to do what i be
lieve is right and ignore the social costs par
ticularly if there is an injustice involved living 

this way has cost me income and friends at 
times but it has helped me make other friends 
and has me at peace with myself frankly i do 
not know any other way to live
i believe the united states is in crisis and it 
is going to take powerful grass roots leadership 

at multiple sectors of our society to save her 
we need to cultivate and mentor passionate 
and committed millennial leaders who have 
the right stu montana state university is a 
great place to do that
my real dream would be to stimulate the 
startup of a social group that would have a 

broader goal students for common sense 
would promote truth by battling political cor
rectness i believe there is a growing need for 

a group like that on college campuses around 
the country in light of the emerging anti free 

speech language codes at some schools and 
political bias in the professor class ere are 
some indications that the political correct
ness craze may have peaked and students are 
seeking other more honest expressions please 
contact me if you would like to be involved in 
students for common sense
e funny thing is even though i am a 
conservative i am not a gun guy i dont have 
any guns and i am not a particularly strong 

advocate for increasing the amount of guns 
in society on concealed carry i have an 
open mind i want to study the issue at the 
same time i wish to support young men and 
women that embody small town american 
values that they believe create safe and healthy 
communities i want to support students that 
are trying to contribute to a better world 
ese dudes appear to have the right stu

holds countless awards and 

recognition for the innovative 

research on campus however 

like anything there is room 

for improvement regarding the 

human resources who make this 

highresearch status possible 

msu needs to prove that the 

research workers are a priority and that their 

needs arent overshadowed by the publicity 

they bring to the school
it is common for faculty members to 
apply for grants through the federal and state 
government e lifechanging research 

is sponsored by taxes rather than tuition 

e oce of research and economic 

development promotes awareness of grant 
opportunities among faculty 

additionally there are resources 

to help write grants including 

seminars and editing commit

dent of research and economic

january 2014 and has been 

proactive in making research 

opportunities more available 

to faculty of the 15 million 

research initiative passed by 

the montana legislature 89 

million is going directly to msu

successful research program cannot be 
credited to the school itself but must be 

attributed to the sta graduate assistants 

and undergraduate researchers who made 

it possible
typically when a job is done well there 
are tangible rewards while the program has 
received accolades msu has been bere in 
its duty to monetarily prioritize research 

which brings in the most national attention 

in a normal job wages are assigned based on 

a variety of factors experience education 

level applicable skills etc as one commits 

time and energy to a job the expectation 

is that the worker becomes more ecient 

and more valuable to the company is 

behavior is rewarded 

with raises and ben
ets over the years 

unfortunately 

within the univer
sity research system 

it is not so simple 

undergraduate 

research remains 

one of the few 

jobs on campus 

that does not offer 

a pay raise over 

the average four years of employment 
maintenance and food service offer raises 
undergraduate research has the right to at 

least be on par with those programs
e undergraduate scholars program 
usp is one of the primary ways students 

can become involved in research on campus 

it is a great resource but like so many other 

things on campus more funds would be 

helpful funding comes from the provosts 

oce and is set by the administration 
however usp operates under a setbudget 

erefore the only way it could increase 

stipends to undergraduate researchers 

would be to decrease the number of stu
dents in the program at is a choice that 

shouldnt have to be made if research is 
truly important that should be reected 
in the earnings of the students at the 

very least msu should fund raises for 

returning student researchers scholarships 

are available to athletes why not make 

specic research tuition scholarships 
research is one of the focal points of 
msu e administration has a duty to 

treat it as such by investing more resources 
into the program 

celebration of 

discovery on campus 

needs to be just 

that  a celebration 

ingenuity walks the 

mall everyday and 

is rarely recognized 

for its contributions 

e administration 

holds the money 

card but the 

student body holds 
something more important a voice strong 
enough to implement change students can 
generate more interest in the undergraduate 

research program and create the need for a 

more expansive program is could provide 

opportunities for those in a eld where the 

research options arent as obvious as a micro
scope and a lab coat by promoting a thriv
ing undergraduate scholar community now 

msu is protecting the future of research
when saying were proud of you just isnt enough
msu must demonstrate with more than words that student research is a priority

college is a place and time with a rich 

concentration of opportunities for intel
lectual social academic and personal 

evolution one of the most powerful 

experiences undergraduate students can 

have is researching or studying with a 

professor the mentorship model of edu
cation is the oldest and most potent e 

ability to study with an expert in your 

eld is an unparalleled opportunity
at opportunity is not a right but a privilege 
and it can be abridged when university administration 

has other priorities montana state has grown rapidly 

in recent years between 2002 and 2014 the fulltime 
undergraduate population increased 22 

percent recent years have exhibited many 

visible changes the renovation of gaines 

hall construction of jabs hall two new 

undergraduate housing complexes a 

remodel of miller and a food truck during 

this same 12year period the amount of 

fulltime faculty with terminal degrees 

in their respective eld has dropped by 

174 percent though it has risen 5 percent 

since 2013 i have used this qualication 

as an estimator of tenuretrack or tenured 

ttt faculty ere must be enough 
professors conducting research for students to be able 

to take advantage of this opportunity
e current ratio of students to instructional 
faculty at msu is 201 according to the integrated 

postsecondary education data system the mean 

studenttofaculty ratio 

for universities of high 

research activity is 

181 e only way to 

maintain this standard 

at msu is to increase 

hiring of tenuretrack 

faculty at rate propor
tional to that of other 

highquality research universities according to the 

chart growth at northwestern universities msu 

presents strong student growth but is an outlier with 

low faculty growth 
e msu faculty senate took steps to address 
this issue in february 2015 the faculty senate 
prioritization plan to meet msus strategic goals 

outlines what msu must do to maintain and advance 

its status as a premier research university interestingly 
this document does not 

focus on salaries stem 

bias or any of the other 

signicant issues but 

rather on the importance 

of tenured faculty to expe
rience of undergraduates 

e document states 

faculty members are the 
ones who deliver quality education to msu students 

maintaining quality programs takes signicant 

faculty time and interaction and cannot be sustained 

without increasing tenuretrack faculty proportional 

to enrollment e senate advocates increasing the 

instructional component of msus budget by real
locating noninstructional funds e msu board of 

regents recommends that the instructional compo
nent be near 50 percent but it has been at or below 47 

percent since 2011 it is currently 48 percent for 2015 

is may seem like splitting hairs to an undergraduate 

student but this reallocation amounts to around 56 

million almost 360 more per student
e prioritization plan integrates many related 
goals into a single mission with stated objectives 

assess and improve student learning of critical knowl
edge increase graduates pursuing advanced degrees 

elevate the research performance and recognition 

of msu faculty improve ranking among carnegie 

classied research universities increase integration 

of learning increase work across disciplines e 

administration and senate must act to make such 

necessary changes if msu is to continue providing 

comprehensive education
resolving these issues is complicated but under
standing them is not if there isnt enough faculty 

teaching loads increase or some classes are oered less 

frequently most students are familiar with classes 

in art history chemistry and others  that are only 

oered every other year during alternating semesters 

or only when there is enough demand woe to anyone 

who isnt on a perfect fouryear plan is aects 

graduate students as well as teaching loads increase 

tenured professors in labs can teach fewer graduate 

courses e teaching loads are alleviated by lling in 

with adjunct professors who primarily teach and thus 

are not principal investigators and cannot provide 

undergraduate research opportunities and are less 

able to be mentors is is a national trend nearly 70 

percent of faculty nationwide and 75 percent of new 

hires are nontenuretrack faculty according to jack 

schuster and martin finkelstein who published e 
american faculty e restructuring of academic 

work and careers at johns hopkins university in 

2006  rather than using adjuncts as a crutch msu 

should place a greater value on their skills and provide 

more tenuretrack positions
endowing a new chair is of course quite 
expensive new professors are given a startup package 

ranging from tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars 

to start a lab and to cover moving expenses msu 

professors  like trevor douglas and trevor rainey 

both in chemistry  have been drawn away by 

greener pastures at other universities that can aord 

grandeur startup packages  
msu must attract professors of national and 
international recognition rather than create and 

then lose them msus reputation punches much 

heavier than its weight says msu director of 

communications tracy ellig other institutions are 

constantly raiding us montana state produces great 

professors he says but cannot compete nancially 

with universities twice or more its size we have 

hired important research faculty like peter buerhaus 

and matt byerly buerhaus is a renowned nursing 

economist and byerly is the director of the new center 

for mental health research and recovery 
so what administration can do and has done 
is signicant by most measures msu is improving 

rapidly student retention rates are up 46 percent 

since 2009 the fouryear 

graduation rate is up 27 

percent and the sixyear 

graduation rate is up 41 

percent eres still a 

lot we can do said the 

director of planning and 

analysis chris fastnow 

and we have seen faculty 

step up  in math 

economics business  to 

help students meet the 

hurdles according to  

fastnow facultydriven 

developments like ipped 

classrooms increased 

tutoring opportunities 

and the introduction of 

departmental student 

success coordinators have been matched by invest
ment from the university and yield appreciable results 
e administration has a focus on ensuring 
students who begin studies actually graduate e 

current graduation rate aer four years is 235 percent 

a number that does not include students who transfer 

away and graduate elsewhere institutions with more 
tenuretrack faculty tend to have higher retention and 

graduation rates
students who enter college with a clear 
purpose fastnow said are going to nish what 

were trying to do is identify what students dont have 

a purpose then giving them the advice and support 

they need to nd that purpose one program the 

administration has introduced is called early 

alert when professors notice a student who seems 

to be struggling they can alert the department and 

then reach out to that student
such collaborative eorts between faculty and 
administration are driven by data and so far seem to 

be eective it takes quite a while to see if something 

youve done has worked tracy ellig said at least 
six years and cruzado 

has only been here six 

years so were just now 

seeing what these new 

policies are doing
msu is certainly 
on an upward swing 

improving retention 

rates graduation rates 

and research funding 

all indicators seem to 

show that 2016 will 

be an even better year 

than 2015 but msu 

certainly underperforms 

other carnegierated 

research universities 

ellig continued we are 

constantly looking at 
new things we can do to increase those numbers 

these developments manifestly affect the experi
ence of students and faculty more could perhaps 

be done to address complaints 
six years of new policies has certainly borne fruit 
but now is the time to take greater steps forward in 

2013 the montana legislature tied university funding 
to how much student retention and graduation rates 

move so we have an ethical directive as well as 

political and scal motivation ellig said we have 

been making our investments in order to do the 

best we can for our students it is important for all 

in the msu community  from undergraduates to 

administrators  to see the current data clearly it is 

not a condemnation of current policies nor a valida
tion that the policies are perfect e university must 

push forward taking what has worked cutting away

better students to ensure it can back up its punches

grand forks op cats lose another away game
by will hamel
the montana state bobcat 
football team previously favor
ites to win the big sky confer
ence will most likely miss the 
playoffs for the second time in 
three years after they were unable 
to win their first road game at 

the alerus center falling to the 
university of north dakota by a 
score of 3844
 the porous bobcat defense al
lowed 548 yards of total offense 
with 426 yards coming on the 
ground  und freshman running 
backs john santiago and brady 
oliveira accounted for 397 of 
these yards with four touch
downs santiago was especially 
lethal on the ground as two of 

his touchdown runs came from 
45 and 75 yards out he finished 
the day with 230 yards and three 

touchdowns
montana states offense con
tinued to put up huge numbers 
as junior quarterback dakota 
prukop threw and ran for 224 
and 65 yards respectively turn
overs were an issue for prukop as 

he threw two interceptions and 
had a costly redzone fumble in 

the fourth quarter sophomore 
wide receiver jayshawn gates 

led the bobcats with 74 yards on 
the ground and a touchdown 
through the air senior wr 

mitchell herbert had 76 yards 
receiving and a touchdown 
overall the cats put up 479 total 
offensive yards
the first half was a shootout 
as the bobcats long touchdown 

drives were typically answered by 
quick strikes from und north 
dakota led 3124 at the half 

with all four of their touchdowns 
coming either runs or passes of 
30 yards or longer 
both teams continued to trade 
punches in the second half 
points coming at a premium as 

both defenses tightened with 
1238 left in the game and the 

score tied at 38 bobcat junior 
defensive end jessie clark forced 
a fumble on und sophomore 

quarterback keaton studsrud 
which was recovered by bobcat 
freshman defensive back de
monte king at the und 33 yard 

line the cats drove to the 19 

where dakota prukop fumbled 
as he tried to dump the ball 
while under pressure the play 
was initially ruled intentional 

grounding before instant replay 
overturned the call giving the 
ball back to und north da
kota fumbled again at the msu 

47 with 749 left but the cats 
were forced to punt as the of

fense were unable to convert on 
two golden opportunities
und took the lead 4438 
but a missed extra point gave the 

bobcats the opportunity to win 

the game with 141 left on 3rd 
down bobcat sophomore wide 
receiver dropped a wide open 
pass that would have been a first 
down on the next play prukops 

pass was deflected by the und 
defense which sealed north 
dakotas first victory over the 
bobcats since entering the big 
sky conference
the loss drops the bobcats 
to 44 overall and 23 in the 
conference with three games 
left the bobcats will most 

likely find themselves out of the 
playoffs with one of their wins 

coming against division ii fort 

lewis the bobcats will be unable 
to reach seven division i wins a 
mark which is often considered 

necessary to enter the playoffs
in order for the cats to avoid 
their first losing season since 

2001 they will need to win two 
out of their last three games the 
cats will face conference leader 
southern utah next saturday 
nov 7 at bobcat stadium the 

next week the cats will travel for 

their final away game of the sea
son at idaho state and then the 

following week the cats will end

the bobcat volleyball squad made trips 
to idaho and washington to take on two 
big sky conference opponents late last 
week the cats took on the university of 
idaho vandals and the eastern washington 

university eagles on thursday oct 29 

and friday oct 30 respectively
the bobcats traveled to moscow idaho 
on thursday to take on the vandals mon
tana state struggled with containing the 

vandal offense and idaho outhit msu 

383 to 154 the bobcats jumped to a 73 

lead in the first set before idaho evened the 
score at 10 apiece the score was tied seven 
more times before the vandals pulled away 

to take the first set 2519 the vandals 
took the second set with a score of 2519 
in the third set the vandals jumped out 

to a 81 lead before cruising to a 2512 
victory the team came out focused 
and played really well to start that match 
versus idaho but we unfortunately couldnt 
sustain it for the whole match msu head 

coach jj riley said idaho did a great job 

of responding to our quick start and just 

played steady solid volleyball the bobcats 

were led offensively by freshmen chase 
doughty and natalie passeck with nine 
and seven kills respectively 
any time you can get young players 
game experience it bodes well for the 
future especially when they are getting sub
stantial minutes and matches under their 

belts riley said the young players are 

going to have a much better grasp of life 

as a div i athlete as well as have a better 
feel for their competition after this season 

which will help them in their preparation 

mentally and physically for next year
the cats travelled to cheney wash to 
take on the eagles of eastern washington 

montana state came out hot in the first set 
and took a 10 lead with a 2522 victory 
the cats then jumped ahead in the second 
set but a 113 run by the eagles was 
enough for ewu to come back and take 

the second set 2624 the bobcats rallied 

in the third set and took a 21 lead with a 

score of 2523 unfortunately for the cats 

the eagles soared back in the fourth set 

dominating and taking a 2515 victory to 
even up the score at two sets apiece in the 
final set the eagles jumped out to an early 
lead before the cats took a 1211 lead the 
eagles finished off the set with a lead to 

take the deciding set and win 32 senior 
natalee godfrey led the bobcats with 15 
kills and passeck contributed 13 kills 
i think eastern stepped up when their 
backs were against the wall and played 
really well in that fourth set riley said 
they were at home knew they had to 
win and they have had some success this 
season so they buckled down and came out 

swinging
the bobcats will host north dakota 
on thursday nov 5 in brick breeden 

fieldhouse the bottom line is the team 

has done a great job of working hard and 
supporting each other all year riley said 
the focus is on getting better everyday 

and i know this team will continue to focus 
on that as they have done a great job of it 
to date the game begins at 7 pm
any time you can get young players game experience it 
bodes well for the future especially when they are getting 
substantial minutes and matches under their belts 
 head coach jj rileythe loss drops the bobcats to 44 overall and 23 in the conference 
with three games left the bobcats will most likely nd themselves 
out of the playoffs

backcountry ski etiquette at fairy lake
by 
theodore
 grover
each year the rst snowfall in 
the bridgers signies the opening 
of fairy lake mountain resort 

no its not actually a resort it 
lacks the typical amenities found 
at mainstream ski areas ere 

are no chairlis no trail markers 

or any avalanche control of any 
kind is is a backcountry ski area 
encompassing the bowls surround
ing fairy lake a ski area where 

you have to earn your turns one 

step at a time so why should one 

ski fairy lake mountain resort 
well it boasts one of the earli
est opening dates of any location 
in the country with the bridger 
bowl cloud reliably ring up the 
snow guns each october one can 

drive almost all the way to the 
runs which beats hiking ten miles 
to make some subpar turns on a 

remote peak furthermore theres 
no pesky ski patrol to tell you what 
you can and cant do however 

that doesnt mean one shouldnt 

abide by the fairy lake code of 
conduct
first and foremost dont try 
and drive up fairy lake road 

without four wheel drive you 
wont make it youll inevitably 

spin out get stuck and become a 
hazard to other cars on the road 
lets say you try anyways chances 

are youll make it to the death 
hill about four and a half miles 
up the road about half way up 

the death hill it will become ap
parent that your car wont be able 
to make it to the top and it will 
then slide uncontrollably back 
down to the base of the hill is 

brings us to the second statute of 

the fairy lake code of conduct 

dont park at the base of the death 

hill a parked car at the base of 

the death hill is an easy target 

for other cars sliding down ere 

is plenty of space along the road 

to park before death hill where 

your car wont become collateral 

damage 
arrival at the resort proper is 
where the real fun starts and our 

next statute takes form unless 

theres been a phenomenal early 

season dump bring rock skis it 

will be dicult to avoid every sin
gle rock so bring skis that youre 

not afraid to ruin its more fun 

to just shred than to ski conserva
tively around rocks anyways and 

speaking of rocks dont knock 

scree down onto other people 
when there are only a few inches 

of snow separating the bootpack 

from the rocks lurking beneath it 

can be easy to knock a few rollers 

loose be careful where you step 

and try to avoid knocking rocks 

down onto skiers climbing below 

you 
perhaps the most important 
statute however is to have fun 

most people arent afforded 

the opportunity to ski before 
thanksgiving let alone ski long 

windbuffed couloirs take 

advantage of the awesome early 

season riding conditions that 

materialize each fall at fairy 

lake mountain resort but do 

so responsibly fairy lake is a 

special early season location that 

deserves respect and demands 

good judgement the resort is 

now open for the season so get 

up there and earn some turns

come out of this stretch of river 
old mean and bucktoothed 
theyre the kind that will wait 

until you see them to throw the 
hook and then take off back 
into deep water with that tail 

flip that is fish speak for screw 

you these are not smallstream 
softmouthed cutthroat trout 
who give up after a few seconds 
of fight on some tough tackle 
these are the kingofthehole 

fish whose fat hangs over your 

hands in rolls when you hold 
them up for pictures its for these 
fish that ive made the two hour 

trip before the sun comes up
i park next to hauser dam and 
pull out my rods having been

i moved out here for school i 

try to bring my fly rod and make 
some casts for a little bit every 
time i go out but i will always be 

a spin fisherman at heart i grew 
up casting too many panther 
martins into too many beauti

ful pinelined river beds to be 

anything else
the sun is up but nothing is 
warm yet i hike across the dam 

and down the canyon walls fol
lowing the river to the hole im 

going to fish its a nicely formed 

bend in the river and theres 
some good slack water holding 
three pound rainbows after 

catching a little eightincher 

and losing a solid two pounder 
which involved a lot of swear
ing i work my way upriver to 
my secondtolast spot of the day 

this is faster moving water it 
flows right past the edge of the 
canyon into a bend in the rock 
and then back into the main 
current its high noon now and 

the warmth begins to unfreeze 

my cold stiff fingers i grab my 
spinning rod and tie on my lucky 
panther martin on my first cast 
it proves its worth my rod bends 
into a beautiful u and the fish 

takes off into the main current 
reel screaming as line comes off 
the spool he jumps then and i 
get a look at him too far away to 

tell the species but close enough 

to know that this is a big fish i 
take a deep breath adjust my drag 
and settle in for a fight
the fish keeps fighting in the 
main current trying to swim 

downstream hes about 80 

yards out now so i have some 

work to do every time he takes 

a break i get to work i get into 
my rhythm pull back on the rod 

reel forward repeat let the fish 

run when he needs to as long 
as he has to work for the line he 
takes out it makes him tired and 
slow he makes five more runs 

trying to get away in the current 

and jumps three more times but 
each time he jumps lower and 
runs slower and i am gaining line 

all the while now hes close i 

can see him and i begin to worry 

make sure the line doesnt break 

dont pull too hard dont pull too 

soft hes gonna run again when 

he sees you so stay on him
as any fisherman knows there 
is always a last bit of fight in a 

fish when they get pulled close 
to the bank and catch sight of a 
gargantuan twolegged creature 
with a stick in his hand the 

second this fish sees me his 

survival instincts kick in and he 
takes off on one last run but 
ive won this fight i pull the 

fish onto the bank to get a look 

at and weigh him its a huge 

rainbow  the biggest ive ever 

caught in my life two feet long 

from tip to tail and weighing in 

at five pounds eleven ounces 
i take a few pictures and then 

put him back in the water all 

of this has taken less than three 
minutes
soon always too soon its 
time for me to go i trudge back 
up to the car pack away all my 

gear and hit the road i didnt 
catch any of the big browns i 
was after today no ten pound 

monsters to grace the screen
saver of my computer no hook 

jawed leviathans to bring to 

the riverside  at least not this 

time i guess that means ill just 

have to come back oh darn

dead poets slam promises to be the rst of many
by kaycee cronk
stepping into townshends teahouse 
on friday evening oct 30 was akin to 
stepping into another world bozeman  
beautiful but familiar  remained at the 
door and everything beyond was haunted 

by the spirit of elsewhere there were 

more bodies than chairs and people were 
left clinging to the walls as they waited for 
the beginning of a truly unique event the 

dead poets slam as the poets took to the 
stage emotions were laid bare old wounds 
were reopened and words were spilled in 

the place of blood in bozemans firstever 

slam poetry competition
the competition opened with a sacri
fice during which a friend of the event 

warmed up the evening with a recitation 

from there the slam truly kicked off a 
collection of brave poets bared their souls 
to the assembled crowd reciting original 

works of spoken art the poems ranged 

from gutwrenching tragedies to humor
ous anecdotes to celestial abstractions 

volunteers from the audience became 

the judges of the competition  armed 

with whiteboards and expo markers the 
newlyappointed judges decided the fate 
of the contestants with nothing more 

than a single number between one and 

ten as the poets exited the stage the 
everencouraging crowd acknowledged 
the contestants bravery with a chorus of 

applause echoing master of ceremonies 

kelly mullins oftrepeated phrase lets 
hear it for the poet and not the scores
five contestants moved on to the 
second round and only two made the cut 
for the final round it was a tough call for 
the judges as both of the final contestants 
were formidable wordsmiths the win ul
timately went to jack dawkins a massage 
therapy student who recently wandered 
into the bozeman area 
i began writing spoken word poetry 
about two years ago dawkins said and 

since then ive traveled quite a bit with 

spoken word personally im not formally 

trained to do any of these things i pretty 

much just look at the microphone as my 
therapist
while the first half of the evening mir
rored a traditional poetry slam the second 
half was dominated by the dead poets 

slam this competition saw contestants 
reciting poems by writers long dead and 
gone but with a twist rather than simply 
reading the poems in a traditional style 
they did so in slam style often associ
ated with dimlylit rooms and snapping 
in the place of applause slam style is 

characterized by high emotion and is 
very powerful when witnessed in person 
school of film and photography professor 
stephanie campbell along with two pro
fessors from the english department  

zachary bean and ben leubner  judged 
the dead poets slam 
after listening to nearly a dozen poems 
some of which were quite familiar  such 

as dylan thomas do not go gentle into 
that good night  dawkins was ulti
mately crowned champion of the second 
competition as well for his reading of the 
nonsensical two dead boys
as the emcee pointed out continuously 
throughout the night this was bozemans 
firstever slam poetry competition but 

organizer david shields says it wont be 
the last weve been wanting to do a slam 
in bozeman since we started the open mic 
two years ago shields said and the dead 
poets slam came about because i wanted 
to revive things that we dont get to hear 
when we go to a standard poetry slam 

there will definitely be more it was a good 
turnout everybody had fun and weve 
learned lots of things
the bozeman poetry collective meets 
for an open mic on the second monday of 
every month at townshends teahouse and 
also on the last friday or saturday of every 

month at the bozeman public library 
more information about their upcoming 
open mic nights and poetry slams can be 
found on their facebook page at

proper procrastination previews
by adam waldorf
its gotten to the point in the semester 
where youre trying to work off the crip
pling sadness that comes with the end 
of midterms but still preparing to face 

the inevitable depression that tends to 
come with finals week there are many 
different ways to deal with this type of 
failure you can study but who really 
wants to do that give up on your hopes 

and dreams to join the circus or drink 
an absurd abundance of alcohol which 
is the most plausible choice luckily 

for you its the beginning of the month 
so you can give your liver a break and 
watch all of the new movies that netflix 

has to offer  
the good
marvels jessica jones season 1

last year netflix released daredevil 
which many people were skeptical 

about given that the ben affleck movie 

was such trash however netflix went 
over the top and made a dark gritty 
superhero television show that took 

everyone off guard critics and netf
lix users alike because of the success 
that netflix had adapting superhero 

movies im optimistic about what they 
are going to do with marvels jessica 
jones jessica jones is already a dark 

superhero tale so im looking forward 
to seeing how netflix takes it from the 
comics to the screen
last days in vietnam

im not a huge fan of documentaries 
that being said i have heard nothing 
but good things about last days in 
vietnam the movie gives insight about 

american soldiers in the final days of 
vietnam these soldiers are faced with 
a moral dilemma evacuate the us 

citizens in vietnam or prevent the im
minent slaughter of south vietnamese 
citizens from the northern vietnamese 

army the thing this movie does well is 
ask the viewer what would you do 

because of this last days in vietnam 

stands out and should be worth the 

watch 
the badthe runner

i have never seen a movie i enjoyed 
where nicolas cage was the lead his 

acting is dull and unpolished and every
thing he says is predictable it seems hes 

always whispering or screaming which 

makes it a chore to watch because of 
this hes usually unlikable which made 
it seem like he would be perfect to play a 
politician he wasnt in the runner 
he plays a politician whose life is thrown 
horribly awry after a sex scandal the 
script is cringy the acting is stale and 

the plot is dull the movie is straightup 
bad 
anna karenina
movies based around classic novels 
tend to be hit or miss it can be a rous

ing success like pride and prejudice 

or to kill a mockingbird but more 
often than not they tend to be inconsis
tent and unappealing to audiences like 
gullivers travels the hobbit and 
in this case anna karenina while the 
costume design is stellar and the acting 
is passable the story of anna karenina 
isnt exciting enough to appeal to the 
majority of audiences i havent read the 

original material so i dont know if the 
movie follows the book but the movie 
was almost completely unwatchable due 
to its pacing
the uglyrobot overlords

i feel like the title the ugly has to 
go to some sort of cheesy scifi movie 

while there are no sharknadotype 

movies coming out in november there 
is robot overlords in this movie 

robots have enslaved humanity and the 
humans wear implants so the robots 

know if the humans are outside if they 
are they die then the humans decide 
to fight back this is a typical cgrade 
science fiction movie the acting is poor 
the special effects are bad and the script 

is laughable  but its a blast to watch 

with friends for a good laugh
coltranes legendary a love 
supreme enters fth decade
by keegan grady
the legendary jazz musician stan 
getz once said if you like an instru
ment that sings play the saxophone 
it is indeed a unique instrument 

 a strange hybrid of a trumpet and 

clarinet its got a sensual shape and a 

golden tone to match and on a winter 

afternoon in new jersey in the year 

1964 john coltrane created a song like 

no other saxophone had sung before
the beginning of a love supreme 
is not even a jazz instru
ment traditionally  its 

a gong immediately 

followed by a swift saxo
phone riff it is a serene 

and ethereal beginning 

then the otherworldly 

nature drops away and 

the bass takes over with a 

simple fournote theme 

later coltrane takes 

over with a chant a love 

supreme a love supreme set to that 

same blues theme the track is called 

acknowledgement and thats what it 

feels like  a nod to the music and as 

coltrane had in mind an acknowledge
ment of god
a love supreme also marks a deep 
transition for coltrane himself it was 

the switch from bebop and hard bop 

to free form jazz and the beginning 

of a religious resurgence of sorts the 

album is named for the supreme love of 

god  though coltrane doesnt specify 

what religions god he means after a 

love supreme his songs and albums 

began to take on spiritual overtones 

ascension meditations prayer and 

meditation suite om the last song 

of a love supreme is called psalm 

it is accompa
nied by a poem 

written by col
trane celebrat
ing the wonder 

and mystery of 

god 
eric funk 
msu music 

professor and a 

jazz musician 

emphasized 

pay attention 

to how col
tranes playing 

 captures the 

poem he wrote 
for the liner notes coltrane called it a 

musical narration it is rare to clearly 

hear a voice present in an instrument 

but that is what happens in psalm 

you sit engrossed in the looping twist
ing melody and suddenly you realize 

you cant hear a saxophone anymore 

it is a human voice made all the more 

eloquent by being inhuman
a love supreme is not what could 
be termed easy listening at times 

it is harsh eerie and frenetic the 

instruments seem to be doing different 
things  the drums beat 

out violent rhythms the 

bass rumbles furiously the 

piano lays down dissonant 

chords and coltrane soars 

above it all seemingly in his 

own private world and yet 

miraculously everything 

meshes you are left with 

sweat on your brow and 

tears in your eyes casual 

jazz fans will likely shrink 
from the walls of raw sound that the al
bum gives you but if you sit and listen 

you find that the music is incredible 

even in the dark and brooding sections 

there are moments of clarity and utter 

beauty  a single pure high note above 

a rolling drum or a beautiful meeting 

of piano and saxophone it is as if col
trane is asking us to engage with him in 

a religious ritual 
this is part of the magic of coltrane 
 the power to cross boundaries and 

time funk remembers seeing carlos 

santana in san rafael he was wearing 

a black baseball hat with a love su
preme in red cursive across the front it 

wasnt lost on me he said it is honest 

music pure and simple
a love supreme has not lost its 
presence even 

50 years after its 

original release 

listening in my 

crowded dorm 

room i was back 

in a new jersey 

studio in decem
ber somehow 

a passenger to 

history from the 

next room came 

the sound of a 

saxophone  for 

a moment it 

sounded like a 

poem
his saxophone 
is a human 
voice made 
all the more 
eloquent 
by being 
inhuman

 improvised roasted garlic 
chicken linguine 
by juliana hart
i was searching through my cookbook 
recently looking for a new recipe to 
try i came across one for homemade 

alfredo sauce and as i quite like fettuc

cine alfredo i decided to try it in doing 

so i created an entirely new and in my 

humble opinion delicious recipe it 

might seem strange to say that i made 

something new by following a recipe 

but the recipe i was following was only 

for a sauce i added to that sauce what i 

thought might make it better noodles 

were an obvious choice but chicken 

sounded like it might round out the 

recipe
roasted garlic chicken linguine is 
excellent for a date night dish though 

it may seem a bit extravagant it is 

perfectly fine for a common dinner as 

well i prefer to use linguine  its the 

best option when compared with other 

noodles it is the perfect thickness as it 

is thinner than fettuccine but thicker 

than spaghetti feel free to play around 

with what you like though  a recipe 

can always be improved
ingredients
3 diced chicken breasts 

5 minced medium or large cloves of 
garlic

directions
1     cook and drain the pasta

2     while the pasta is cooking melt

chicken until the chicken is lightly 

browned and the garlic chunks are a me
diumdark brown maintain the chicken 

so it doesnt burn
3     meanwhile in a smallmedium 
sauce pan heat the 1 cup 2 sticks of 

butter and 1 cup of whipping cream 

stir it frequently until the butter is com
pletely melted and it starts to bubble 

simmer about 10 minutes or as long 

as you like i do so until the chicken is 

cooked stirring every now and again 

remove from heat and stir in the cheese 

and salt add pepper and garlic powder 

to taste

bartender editionwhite dog bozeman spirits great additions to locally made selection
by conor glesner
god bless local booze every time 
i see a new local brewery i feel lucky 
to live in a time when such a wide 
amazing variety of local beers is 
available to me it seems every year 

bozeman sees new small local busi
nesses committed to providing high 
quality products on a scale perfectly 

suited for a town like ours ey say 

food tastes better when you cook 
it yourself and that logic applies to 
local products too bozeman beer 

is just better in bozeman i had this 

in my mind when i visited the new 

white dog brewery on main street
white dog is housed in a small 
building just adjacent to the baxter 

hotel downtown but unbeknownst 

to me at the time they actually share 
the space with another local business 
 the bozeman spirits distillery 

amazingly this small building not 

only houses the storefronts for both 
buildings but also the production 
facilities for each respective alcohol 

despite sharing the space the two 

companies are entirely separate 

although the owner of the distillery 
is a partowner of the brewery
when rst entering the building 
you are presented with two doors 
one on the le for the distillery and 
one on the right for the brewery 
ill head le rst e distillery 

celebrated its one year anniversary 

recently having been rst opened 
by jim harris on halloween of last 
year bozeman spirits storefront 

is a warm woodpaneled aair 

with a bar running down one side 

and chairs and tables lining the 
other e locallybrewed spirits are 
displayed with pride along the bar 

however the most eyecatching 

feature is a twentyfoot high window 

in the back that shows the stills with 
the distiller at work attending to 
mammoth steel and copper tanks 

with two dogs at his heel i talked to 

the distiller omas mcguane about 

the distillery in more detail
he walked me around the impres
sively small space pointing to 2000 

pound sacks of grain in one corner 
and a wall of wooden barrels in 
another e most fascinating and 
prominent features are the enor
mous stills some twenty feet tall 

connected by a spider web of tubes 

and valves he walked me through a 

hypothetical batch of whiskey
ats where the mash is cooked 
he pointed to a large brass container 

not too long or well end up with 
something like porridge next he 
pointed to a series of large steel 

tanks with small circular windows 

on the front of them here i add 

steam and depending on how high 

the liquid goes i know when to add 
more some clear prewhiskey was 
bubbling behind one of the small 

windows once distilled the whiskey 
will go into charred barrels for aging 
currently the most aged whiskey 

that bozeman spirits oers is nine 

months but mcguane plans to 

extend that time by larger increments 
for as long as the distillery is open 
aside from whiskey bozeman 
spirits also produces and bottles rum 
vodka gin and bitters depending on 

your thirst you can go and just have a 
cocktail at the distillerys bar or you 
can buy it by the bottle aer seeing 

the thought and eort that goes into 

their product i highly recommend it
next lets head next door 
white dog brewing company 

is the younger brother of the two 

businesses having opened a mere 

four months ago e brewery is 

coowned by two brothers  joe 
and troy harris i met up with joe 
to talk about the business much 

like the distillery white dog has a 
warm storefront with a bar along one 
side and seating along the other e 

bar is especially interesting since it 

is made of bricks from the historical 

lehrkind brewery that was recently 

demolished it also sports something 
entirely unique to any bar in boze
man a cooled frost rail where you 
can place your beer to keep it cold 
from start to nish much like the 
distillery there is also a huge window 

in the back that looks into the brew
ery itself rows of enormous steel 

tanks line each wall 
ese are the ones we use to 
ferment or age the beers joe moore 

told me pointing to one side of the 

brewery and these are where we 

put them when they are ready he 
said pointing to the other side of the 
room e beer is pumped directly 

from the large tanks to the taps at 

the bar each of the large tanks has a 
name printed in black letters on the 
front  moore told me they are the 
names of old dogs just a way we can 

remember them
aer the tour i sat down at white 
dogs bar and ordered a red lager im 

a huge fan of any kind of red so i was 
more than eager to try a local brew 
it doesnt disappoint its malty but 

not overpowering  a very pleasant 
beer to drink e avor is subtle and 
over time it allows less prominent 

notes to come through rather than 
letting a single avor overtake the 
whole experience at seems to be 

an overall theme at white dog you 
wont nd exotic triplehop black 
ipas there what you will nd are 

traditional wellmade brews e 
bartender was kind enough to let me 
try a sampler later on and tasting 

all the beers solidied this idea to 
me each is a good beer in its own 
respect and there isnt anything thats 

trying to be dierent its just a solid 
traditional lineup that is well craed 
honestly i prefer that you can try 

them for yourself at the storefronts 

bar or get a sixpack of their ipa that 
can be found in the coop on west 
main street
so whats the moral drink local 
i got a rsthand look into the eort 

and passion with which these local 

alcohols were made and it has only 
strengthened my desire to take in all 
that bozeman oers me take advan
tage of it as much as possible

sonwhat might balloon sculptures have 
to do with the topics of business and 
entrepreneurship 
arguably not much 
however several high school students 

from around montana had the opportu
nity to form a connection between these 
two things and so much more on their 
trip to montana state for the jake jabs 
entrepreneurship event that took place 
in the sub ballrooms 
the monday 
nov 9 event began with speaker scott 
bryant opening the morning up with 
an introduction of himself and 
korrin engel the assistant director of 
new 
student programs 
after several introductions and an 
overview of msus business curriculum 
associate 
teaching professor of business 
gary bishop and les craig of the black
stone launchpad helped start the day off 
with an ice breaker communication activ
ity in which the visitors were to assemble 

the best possible poker hand for a prize 

the next activity had the students write 
their name their passion and a brand 

of some kind on a balloon 
then they 
were instructed to combine their groups 
balloons into the most creative rubber 
monstrosity they could design 
msu graduate 
kendall miller spoke to 
the crowd about her time at the univer
sity miller who graduated in the spring 
2015 managed to chop her way through 

her tuition with her very own peach busi
ness showing the guests some of what can 

be gained from pursuing a business degree 

in bobcat country 
another speaker 
who lent her voice to the event was brie 

thompson owner of the upcoming boze
man establishment 
olivelle a business 
where one can purchase food for an event 
and take cooking classes to broaden their 
horizons
the event like many that involve high 
school students allowed the visitors to 
take tours around campus and experience 

some of what msu has to offer 
this 
tour included a unique opportunity to 

look at the recently finished jabs hall 

bishop described the days final event 
after lunch the crowd gathered back up 
in the ballrooms and conducted one last 
exercise which involved the building of 
more than just a team 
this final activ
ity required the teams to build the most 

spectacular sculpture possible from only 

construction paper and materials to hold 

it together 
this resulted in a variety of 
projects but the winner was a sixteen

foot tall sculpture that had two ping pong 

balls placed at the very top was a standout

bobcats fall at home for rst time this season
by 
an
drew w
at
ers
it was the tale of two teams 
heading in dierent directions as 
the bobcats took on the un
derbirds of southern utah on 

saturday 
nov 5 at bobcat stadium 
southern utah entered the contest 

tied for the lead of the big sky 
conference with a record of 62 

and 50 against big sky competi
tion while the bobcats had their 

playo hopes eliminated with last 

weeks loss to 
north dakota they 
took the eld looking to gain some 

experience for their young players 
montana state head coach rob 
ash said of the scrap  we were 
just looking to win a game 
it was a 
backandforth game as both teams 
used their individual strengths 
against each other  
 e cats started o the game 
with a 13play 75yard scoring 

drive 
aer a mued punt by the 
bobcats the underbirds drove 45 

yards in 12 plays to tie the game up 
at seven apiece with three minutes 
remaining in the rst half the 
bobcats kicked a 33yard eld goal 
to take the lead and head into the 

locker room with a 107 advantage
montana state put together a 
solid rst half putting up 165 total 

oensive yards  
as expected the 
numberone ranked defense of 

southern utah limited the bobcats 
numberone ranked oense in the 

big sky conference to only ten 
points msu looked poised to 

come out strong in the second half 

but southern utah had other plans
southern utah started the sec
ond half with a quick touchdown 
needing only ve plays to cover 
75 yards e bobcats responded 

with a drive of their own nish
ing with a fouryard run by  junior 
running back chad 
newell  
in what turned out to be the key play 
of the game during the ensuing 
possession on a fourthandseven 
underbird quarterback 
ammon 
olsen ung the ball forward while 
he appeared to be down but aer a 

lengthy review by the ocials they 

determined that he was not down 
and that it was a rst down for 
southern utah 
at was a huge moment in the 
game 
ash said 
it was a gigantic 
swing 
instead of a turnover on 
downs it a rstandten and they 
scored two plays later
it was all underbirds from 
there with two more scores before 
montana state responded in the 
fourth quarter
e bobcats put in a solid all 
around performance holding 
southern utah to only 395 of 
total yards while putting up 420 

total yards themselves but it was 

the wellrounded play of the rst 
place underbirds that eventually 

led to their 3423 victory over the 
bobcats 
ats a very good football 
team they are big and strong 
ash remarked at makes our 
performance even better in my 
mind msu plays against next 
week at 
idaho state and nish out 
the season against the university of 

montana on

the bears took a 2320 lead but the 
bobcats scored seven of the last nine 
points of the set to take set two with a

ried over into the third as the cats 

scored six unanswered points to start

the montana state bobcats started 
off their last home stand against the 
university of 
north dakota friday 
nov 6 in shroyer gym 
the cats lost 
the hardfought game 31 
montana state scored 
the first few points of

145 run to lead 159 

the cats crawled back 
and with the u
nd leading 1914 msu scored 

five unanswered points 

to tie the set at 19 apiece 

the bobcats were unable 
to capitalize on their 

run however and 
north 
dakota took the first set with a score of 

2523 
montana state jumped ahead in the 
second set and led 104 before u
nd 
rallied back to tie it at 10 apiece 
the 
score was tied 10 more times before 

north dakota scored two unanswered 
and won the second set 2523 
the 
biggest challenge for us is focusing on 

what we can do on the court and not 
worry about the past montana state 

head coach jj riley said 
i think 

weve done a great job this year of get
ting better at it but it is still a focus for 

us
montana state came out strong in 
the third set and established an early 
lead leading 1816 the 

cats went on a 72 run 

to close out the third set 

and force a fourth we 
came out fired up in the 
third set sophomore 

kasey 
altman said we 
really played like a team 

and maintained that in
tensity we started with
the lead changed 
several times early in 

the fourth set with the 
score tied at 11 apiece u
nd outscored 
msu 72 to take a commanding 1813 

lead with the score at 2320 u

bobcats in kills with 15 and freshmen 
chase doughty and 
natalie passeck 
each contributed with 13 kills apiece

asked for the opposite reason ey

the playos what else is there to 

talk about
outdoor
se music of the river and why shing 
is called shing not catching
by 
nick kasser
you push your foot down on the pedal 
and listen to the engine rev up and roar 
e gears thunk as they shi into place and 

propel you out of the parking lot you listen 

to the hum of the highway beneath your tires 

and sip your can of pop that you got at the 

gas station you turn the radio dial fumbling 

for a channel with no static and not too 

many commercials
you drive a little slower because youre 
looking at the river 
its beautiful to drive 
down a highway that mirrors the motions 

the river makes 
a twist here a turn there a 

straightaway with a really nice hole at the tail 

end of the run you think maybe you should 

get out and throw a few casts but then you 

remind yourself that you still have a long way 

to drive and so you press on
e true beauty of shing is in the quiet 
time everyone writes about the exciting 

part where the sh hits and you pull him in 

and there he is gorgeous golden sides and 

blah blah blah  its in the quiet time of sh
ing where you nd the enjoyment catching 

sh is always more fun than not catching 

sh and it certainly makes for a better story 

but you do not mind listening to the song 

of the river 
in some places its a heavy metal 
roar rushing water slipping over a ledge and 

pounding the river rocks below 
other places 
its more upbeat more alternative dorothy 
the 
kongos swirling water matches up 
with swirling fuzz on a guitar amp and the 

drumbeat of the current drives the river to 

solo and curl back in on itself 
and in still 
more places the song is a slow dance 
a mur
mur 
a tango 
a love aair between current 

and shore where the river slows down and 

brushes gently past the overhanging trees on 

the banks
its been two hours since you started 
shing and still no bites you start to get 

desperate now switching from your old 

standby lures to the ones you never use 

but there is still something profound about 

endless casts into endless waters even when 

there are no sh to be had e sh have 

music all their own and it too is beautiful 

but they could not exist without the song of 

the water
you are still casting now thinking you 
should have gone later in the day but this 

was the only time you could go because 

of that stupid project 
its due at noon on 
sunday but you work all day sunday so you 

had to get it done this morning and you 

knew you should have just gotten up early 

and shed and then nished the project 

but then you would have had to cram it in 

and  another cast 
and another still no 
sh you listen to the song the river makes 
you walk downriver to try another hole 

your boots are muddy and youre thinking 

about getting in and wading even though 

you dont have waders sure itd be cold but 

your heater works  yeah but then youd 

have to drive back soaking wet the whole 

day because any selfrespecting cop would 

probably pull you over for driving in noth
ing but your underwear
its time to go and you start packing up 
your gear in a bit of shellshock 
its been 
awhile since youve been skunked like that 

oh well some days are like that and even 

though you didnt catch any sh you did not 

go home empty handed youll drive home 

goodquiet with river song in your head 

just as you are heading back up to the car a 

sh jumps right in the hole where you were 

shing bastard some days that would annoy 

you but today you smile and head back up to 

the warmth of your car youll be back

as the skies turn gray and the 
temperatures drop skiers boarders 
and ice climbers get jittery 
nights 
are spent waxing and rewaxing 
the planks we shred on skins are 
trimmed edges sharpened tools 

led last minute training begins 

strengthening legs for the dreamy 

endless pow runs preparation of the 

physical technical and mental variety 

begins 
one thing greatly overlooked 
especially during the preseason stoke

driven enthusiasm is avalanche safety 

and awareness
 regardless of how little snow is 
on the ground if you can shred it it 

can slide is is apparent with the 
two recent avalanches that have hap
pened near bozeman one triggered 
by two hunters on sacajawea causing 

one hunter to get injured and put in 

the 
icu and another recent slide 
triggered by skiers on emigrant peak 

preseason skiing has many possibili

ties for injuries with large potential 

to ground you for the entire season 

to mitigate the risks of screwing up 
shredding prior to the lis running 
there are a few things to refresh on 

before heading out to ski fairy lake 
mountain resort or whatever strip of 
snow you can jump on
first and foremost is being up to 
date with you avalanche equipment 
just like skis need to be tuned and 
sharpened taking care of and being 

aware of the condition of your safety 

gear is of utmost importance 
take 
your beacon and check the charge 

if youre running even mildly low 
replace the batteries keeping in mind 
the specic type of batteries used in 
your beacon make sure to clean any 

corrosion that could have built up 

during the previous season check to 

make sure your shovel and probe are 

in working order as well while its 
important to understand that your 
gear is in good condition it is useless 

if you dont remember how to use it
take the time to practice searching 
with a beacon and go through simu
lated rescues before heading back into 

the mountains get a group of friends 

especially the ones you will frequently 

go into the backcountry with and 

practice practice practice do beacon 
checks  making sure that your 
beacon and your friends beacons 
are ready to go having avy gear does 
nothing if you and your friends cant 
use it to nd people check your 

subscription settings on 
mtavalanche

com
 dig pits if possible and pay at
tention to the weather 
it is important 
to get a strong understanding of what 

is happening in the snowpack from 

the beginning of the year and tracking 

where it goes throughout the ski 

season 
if you dont remember much 
about reading avalanche terrain make 
sure to follow up on it study ava
lanche rescue techniques terrain traps 
and hazards and anything you can to 

learn more unlike the college classes 

you take study this information 

with a passion while failing an exam 
resulting in a bad grade screwing up 
in avalanche terrain has much more 

immediate and fatal outcomes re
sources can be but are not limited to 

classes put on by the gallatin 
national 
forest 
avalanche center websites 
like 
avalancheorg
 and books such as 
staying 
alive in 
avalanche 
terrain 
written by bruce 
tremper remem
ber that any studying you do is only 
supplemental to taking an avalanche 
class 
and 

cannot 
replace taking 
a certied avy 

course
skiing in fall can be 
a rad and super fun time 
albeit rocky and most likely 
going to result in a core shot can 

someone say rock skis getting out 
there preseason can be an awesome 

adventure 
it can however end in less 
than desirable outcomes many of the 
chutes that are skiable preseason result 
from snow deposited by wind and 

that more oen than not they will 

end in rocky talused elds ski one at 
a time and have islands of safety you 
head to dont skimp on practicing 
prop
er 
etiquette and 
awareness as this will lead to shirking 
alertness during the actual season 

planning ahead and prepping prior 

to getting the gnar points from pre
season shreddage will denitely result 

in a season of safety and steeze

illustration by kalie murphy
a mission borne of necessity
at the beginning of abraham lincolns 
second term as president of the united states 
the nation was jaggedly torn in two e 

us trembled on the precipice of permanent 

failure as a union it was under these terrify
ing prospects that lincoln gave his second 

inaugural address on march 4 1865 in this 

desperate and hopeful speech lincoln uttered 

the words forming the standard by which 

the us treats the men and women that have 

served the nations interests
let us strive  to bind up the nations 
wounds to care for him who shall have borne 

the battle and for his widow and his orphan 

to do all which may achieve and cherish a just 

and lasting peace among ourselves and with 

all nations
ese words were the nal sentence 
of lincolns address and in giving them 

he armed a towering obligation for the 

government to uphold today that obliga
tion ocially falls beneath the authority of 

the us department of veterans aairs 

an infamous cabinetlevel arm of the federal 

government locally though and with a 

far more positive track record there is a 
small room in the basement of the sub that 

houses the folks who aim to do their part in 

lincolns endeavour
e veteran support center known 
colloquially as the veterans center resides in 

room 185 of the sub and serves a vital role 

for msu according to brenda york director 

of disability reentry and veteran services 

578 students are currently being served by the 

veterans center as of the current semester
services and safe haven
e veterans center is a refuge and 
home base for these 578 students although 

most of the students served are veterans them
selves a small number are also beneciaries of 

veterans e point of it is its a place where 

they can come in to ll out their paperwork 

for benets study and relax york said e 

space is oen used for events tutoring and 

mentorship as well
e center is staed by knowledgeable 
professionals who can help veterans get setup 

for classes and navigate the ins and outs of 

federal benets
e most important function of the 
centers services is providing resources for 
counseling and a safe place where those 

around have had similar related experiences 

during their time in the service 
its hard for transitioning veterans to go 
into class with 18 and 19yearolds some of 

them dont even know there was a war eres 

a huge disconnect york said erein lies a 

purpose for the center which goes beyond 

paperwork and studying e us has an 

entire generation of servicemembers who have 

fought in a conict that has been farther from 

our minds than any before it sitting in class 

with starryeyed young adults naive to some 

of the harsher realities of the world doesnt 

exactly aid in the transition process
for ryan king an army veteran who 
deployed as an infantryman to iraq and 

afghanistan this particular note rings true 

ive only been out of active duty for two 

years its been three years since the end of 

my second deployment ats really not that 

long when you think about it getting out 

and just hopping right into school there was 
really no time to transition at all
king continued so everything is just 
happening all at once and just to have that 

space is nice even if i dont talk to anybody 

i know that im surrounded by similar and 

likeminded people sitting in the same room 

with me
and when a veteran needs a professional 
to talk to the veterans center provides a 

listening ear i called the vet center and 

they referred me to counseling right as soon as 

i needed it king said
bursting at the seams
e number of student veterans being 
served by the space isnt static however e 

demand is growing along with the rest of 

msu according to york there was a 781 

percent increase in veterans studying at msu 

between 2009  2014 e veterans center 

has responded to growth before the center 

didnt even have its current marginal space 

until 2011 ese increasing numbers tell a 

success story msu is known as a veteran

friendly institution
growing seems to be coupled with pains 
however and the veterans centers pain is its 

size the center is only 700 square feet at any 

given time we have 23 seats in the veterans 

center ats including computers tables 

everything explained york a space that size 

is too small given the safespace purpose the 

center serves
e only turno for me is that its so 
small king said e last time the montana 

legislature met a renovation package for 

romney gym which included a sizeable 

upgrade for the veterans center faced the 

legislature and was given a thumbs down
we were talking about doubling the 
space maybe adding a conference room it 

was a need not a want york said e vets 

even went up to the capitol and testied 

to the committee for the need for it e 

legislature was unswayed and since the reno
vation was small part of a larger controversial 

infrastructure bill the benecial results were 
lost in state politics romney gym wouldve 

been nice to have king said
focus for the future
despite having a shot at expansion 
yanked from their grasp the people at the 

veterans center remain focused on their 

mission vets have given to our country so 

lets make sure they get out of here with a 

good education and get jobs ats the end 

goal york said msu is always really right 

there for veterans issues is sentiment 

was conrmed by king e vet center is 
denitely an asset to me
e failed expansion didnt seem to 
surprise york its politics in montana its 

the just way it is
e center will have its chance at 
development again with the next legislative 

session in 2017 until then msu must make 

do with the space that it has
at space is certainly being used in 
an excellent fashion a lot of veterans are 

returning and msu is a prime spot for them 

york said whatever future sessions and 

funding may bring msu can take pride and 

solace in the knowledge that educating those 

that have served is of the utmost priority to 

our institution to care for him who shall 

have borne the battle indeed

10opinion
if you find that youre in a lessthan
ideal position as this semester closes 
im here to tell you that its okay 
its all 
going to be okay youre more valuable 

than a grade and your worth is infinitely 

higher than any test percent
age youre valuable because 

youre you and you exist 
inherent in that sentiment is the 

fact that your value has nothing 

to do with my opinion or this 

article 
these words dont give 
you value 
its something that 
you have and something that is 

most valuable when you recog
nize it in yourself 
id like to add that its 
also okay if you have trouble recognizing 

your own value you dont have to be a 

perfect unicorn beaming with confidence 

all the time but if youre ready please 

dont be afraid to ask for help 
if your 
grades are faltering please reach out to 

a professor or tutor 
if youre homesick 
and feeling alone reach out to a friend 

and let them know where youre at and 
what youre feeling 
if life feels like too 
much to handle and your mental health 

isnt where youd like it to be reach out 

to counseling and psychological services 

cps or another counselor 
it takes a certain level of 
strength and awareness to ask 

for help renowned social 

researcher and storyteller brene 

brown explains that the courage 

to admit that we cant handle 

everything on our own takes 

vulnerability and trust of those 

around us knowing the outcome 

is not certain 
i see that cour
age every day on campus around me for 

some its the courage to get out of bed 

despite injury and illness for others 

its the courage to speak out against the 

overwhelming majority for most its the 

courage to show up every day and try 

regardless of the outcome when a few 

cards dont fall our way it can sometimes 

feel like the entire deck is stacked against 

us 
in tattoos on the heart gregory 
boyle writes that god so loved the world 

that he thought wed find the music in it 

while 
i know this doesnt directly apply 

to everyone 
i think the sentiment rings 

universally true 
there are many things in 
this world worth caring about and putting 

effort into and your own mental health is 

one of them 
as the stress generation we 

tend to get into the mindset that stress

ing is caring and that both are essential 

for our future successes planning for the 

future is important but whats the point 

of existing if we dont enjoy it you are 

just as valuable now as you will be in ten 

years and your current happiness is just as 

valuable as the future youre planning for 
mental health isnt something we often 
like to talk about in the open 
its still rel
atively taboo 
in an effort to seem whole 
and unbroken we mask our pain we 

pretend were alright breezing past feel
ings that are outofplace or difficult to 

understand 
in a culture where traditional 
masculine traits are overvalued and 
traditional feminine traits are cast aside 

as inconveniences admitting that we have 

emotions and that we cant always control 

them can be a difficult thing to do 
this 
creates a society where everyone is pre
tending to be totally okay falsely isolating 

those who truly arent 
as we reach the peak of the semester 
when classes are wrapping up clubs are 

hosting final events and stress is at an all 

time high 
id like to encourage everyone 
to take care of themselves 
according to 
the 
national survey on drug use and 
health 
in 2013 nearly 1 in 5 adults aged 
18 or older 185 percent had a mental 

illness in the past year 42 percent had 

a serious mental illness and 39 percent 

had serious thoughts of suicide in the 

past year whether youre dealing with 

serious mental health issues or just feeling 

overwhelmed with the semester there 

are people and programs in place to help 

at msu youre valuable important and 

worthy of benefitting from the resources 

around you
university of missouri highlights importance of student voice

university of missouri president 
tim 
wolfe stepped down monday 
nov 
9 amid racial unrest and controversy the 

result of a movement spearheaded by 

students 
the university of missouri is 
substantially larger than msu 

at 35000 students but their size 

did not hinder the impacts of the 

student voice rather it strength
ened and empowered students in 

their collective fight for justice 
in the recent weeks university 
of missouri students began pres

suring the university asking for 

the resignation of the president 

on the grounds that under his leadership 

the university had not adequately respond
ed to racist incidents on campus or made 

efforts towards making their campus more 

inclusive and welcoming
in a letter written by the missouri 
students 
association their complaints and 

demands were clear they wanted wolfe to 

resign 
the mental health academic quali
ty and physical safety of our black students 

has been compromised time and time again 

 he has not only enabled a culture of 

racism since the start of his tenure in 2012 

but blatantly ignored and disrespected the 
concerns of students  stu
dents from many different races 

genders sexualities abilities and 

other nationalities have not heard 

their identities represented by the 

four core values of this institu
tion  we formally demand the 

immediate removal of um system 

president 
tim wolfe
roughout the protests several 
dierent student organizations made their 

voices heard including the group con
cerned student 1950 named aer the year 

that black students were rst admitted to 

the university of missouri jonathan butler 

graduate student and a member of con
cerned student 1950 announced on 
nov 
2 that he was going to go on a hunger strike 

until wolfe resigned missouri student 
association president payton head wrote the 

aforementioned letter demanding that the 

president steps down e schools football 

team announced that they would not re
sume practices or participate in games until 

wolfe resigned and faculty members can
celed classes in support 
as a result not only 

did the president resign but the chancellor 

r bowen loin did as well 
it seems that the general attitude towards 
larger universities is that an individual 

is nothing more than another number 

head and butler among other students 

have completely disproved that theory 

they are not just another number con
cerned student 1950 the football team  

butler and head the missouri students 

association and hundreds of other stu
dents united to demand change from their 

university and better yet they succeeded 
what univeristy of missouri showed the 
nation was that students can truly make a 

dierence rough organized and dedi

cated activism students were victorious in 
their demands to the university forget just 

a number these students proved that that 

their power was rooted in their numbers 
id like to think that msu administra
tors faculty staff and students are in
credibly welcoming and accepting to all 

students but 
im not naive 
i know that 
is not the truth msu students are no 

exception from the rest of the country and 

unfortunately there are msu students that 

have and will continue to face hateful and 

unwelcoming speech however 
id like 
to think that while msu will always face 

issues of discrimination we are proactive in 

dealing with such issues and as a universi

ty we are making notable efforts to become 

more inclusive and accepting but we can 

always improve the culture on our campus 

to create a more welcoming atmosphere 

for every single msu student lets use the 

university of missouri as a reminder to ex
pect nothing but the best from msu and 

to speak up and speak out when our needs 

are not being met

eycoxopinion editorsometimes when 
i tell people 
i go to 
school in montana 
i have to clarify that 
i really dont ride a horse to school and that 

we have seasons other than winter 

for some reason people are under 

the impression that montana is as 

backwards as it gets 
i like to think 

that regardless of where the rest of 

the state stands msu is progres

sive in a good way
traditionally it is far easier to 
give criticism than it is to accept 

criticism 
it is exponentially harder 
to turn criticism into a productive new path 

msu has successfully turned around a few 

stereotypically bad college experiences in 

essence redeeming those programs for the 

overall improvement of the university 
lets be honest if the school can rework 
miller food into something not only palat
able but at times enjoyable there is really no 

limit to the changes that can be wrought on 

other rough edges e renne library is a 

great example of redemption e faculty at 

the library are constantly working to improve 

their space through collaboration with 

outside programs as well as reaching out to 

students on personal levels plans to improve 

the usability of the library are in the works 

and the library is reaching out to students to 

ascertain how best to meet the needs of the 

21st century student 
any improvements will start with the ser
vices necessary before structure is designed 
ey have already expanded their services 

by allowing students to check out items 

like gopros for weekend adventures and 
phone chargers for late night study 

sessions e librarys relaxation 

stations and paws to destress 

therapy dog programs are maybe 

the only redeeming aspects of

not only have services improved 
but the atmosphere on campus 

is increasingly one of tolerance 

and opportunity last year msu 
was the only school in montana and one of 

only 83 universities in the nation to receive 

higher education excellence in diversity 

recognition 
it underwent an extensive 
review of the integration of groups like 

veterans women in s
tem elds and ethnic 
minorities in recruitment policies programs 

etc e school provided benets to samesex 

partners ten years before the state made gay 

marriage legal 
we may go to school in the middle of 
nowhere but that doesnt mean our school 

lacks direction collaboration is the main re
demptive quality of msu ere will always 

be things to improve but the greatest ght 

is against ignorance sharing of information 

and opinions between students faculty 

alumni administration and the general 

public is the best chance we have of making 

this university into everything we saw on the

lets talk about stress in our generation
for many students a fouryear 
graduation plan is accom
panied by enormous amounts of 
stress unfortunately we are fast 

approaching the semesters pinna
cle of academic stress 

dead week what 
makes the homestretch 
so stressful more so 

than the project dead
lines and final papers 

is the final grade we 
are a society that no 
longer demands aca
demic achievement but 
requires it 
a college degree is a 

necessity with success seemingly 
out of reach for those without 
college graduate status 
the strive for higher educa
tion instilling the concept of 
college as a necessity is even 

federally supported 
this is 
seen with the 
k12 government 
mandated common core state 
standards 
initiative slogan 
preparing 
americas students 
for college  career  what 
once began at a high school level 

college and career preparation 
is now commencing at a kinder
garten level 
the emphasis on 
academic achievement has never 
been higher in this country and 

students are feeling the weight of 

this sink or swim situation
the educational gains attained 
by new societal standards have put 

the millennial generation on track 

to be the most educated gen
eration in our countrys history 
however these standards may 
also prove to be counterproduc

tive 
the same expectations that 
have lead millennials to achieve 

new academic heights can produce 

stressful environments that un
dermine academic performance 
numerous studies show an asso
ciation between poor performance 
and highstakes testing situations
as students we experience 
stress in so many forms with such 

frequency that it has become a 
standard with little thought of its 
consequences stress both acute 

and chronic can be significantly 

damaging to our health affect
ing our emotional control and 
digestive cardiac and muscular 
systems 
one of the worst aspects 
of academic stress is that it is as 
longstanding as our academic 

environment 
as i look back at 

my life 
i realize that 
i have spent 

two decades sitting at desks 
taking tests and listen
ing to lectures 
the 
social contexts making 

friends joining groups 

dating gp
a expecta
tions costs of college 
 all the stresses that 
encompass student 

life have persisted for 

over three quarters of 
my lifetime but all 
i have really 

noticed is acute stress the test 

as it happens then and there the 

rejection from a love interest at 

that moment 
almost all of these 
things are recurring but their per
sistence goes unnoticed chronic 

stress tends to exist beyond our 

awareness as we get used to it
combatting 
the stress that so 

negatively im
pacts student life 

should be made 

a priority 
the 
issue must be 

handled by both 
the individual 
and institution 

msu offers 

several means of 

escape from col
legiate pressure 

it is up to the 

student to seek them 
tutoring 
is available yearround as is the 

gym both of which are excellent 
stressmanagement options and 

are heavily utilized what is gen
erally undervalued and misman
aged however 

is the students 

social life 
as social crea
tures it is im
perative that we 

live some kind 

of life outside of 
the classroom 
engaging with 

friends and 

family 
the dif
ficulty in this is 

balance while 

it is possible 
to maintain a social life dur
ing college many students find 

themselves on either end of the 
spectrum living the party life or 

living the scholastic life 
the fact 
of the matter is that a students 

social life is as vital as the degree 

they are seeking 
the same goes for relaxation 
find a way to relax make time 

for it make a conscious effort to 

remove yourself from your stress

ful environment whether that be 

through hitting the slopes with 
friends lifting weights or stream
ing movies 
as long as it is not 
done so regretfully relaxing could 

be the most beneficial thing you 

do as a student finals are stress

ful enough on their own there 

is all the reason in the world to 

refrain from adding to it so for 

the sake of your health and gp
a 
take a load off

anksgiving and winter breaks are 
coming up soon and with them could be a 
break up from your sweetheart e near 

monthlong break that comes with christ
mas is hell for couples who dont live close 

together many nd that the shortterm 

longdistance relationship 

isnt what they signed up for 

and they oen cant handle 

the split e break gives 

people enough space to start 

being annoyed and angry for 

whatever reason sadly it hap
pens all too oen 
if you want 
to try to save your relation
ship there are a few things 

you can try

letter 
it doesnt have to be 
anything fancy but it has 

to be handwritten  not 

digital digital mail oer 

instant gratication and little 

thought to respond 
an actual letter sent by envelope and snail mail 

oers a sense of joy for those of us who 

actually get excited to see we have mail 

an actual letter takes thought and care 
not to mention the fuzzy feelings your 
words will inspire

the most romantic thing in the universe 

but it oers the lovers in question a chance 

to see each other and talk 
its not quite 
face to face but its pretty close you can 
even chose to make skype dates weekly or 

just a spontaneous thing 
its up to you

cookies and other holiday treats help 

your mom in the kitchen or make some 

special treats all on your own christmas 
is the best time for treats 

and if your sweetheart has a 

penchant for fudge now is 

the perfect time to make it 

for them
e most important thing 
to remember about making 

a long distance relationship 

work is that you both have to 

be willing to make it work 

if the relationship is being 
held up by only one person 

alone it will crash which 

might even be a good thing if 

one person doesnt even see 

the point in trying you both 

need to want to make it until 

you see one another again 
occasionally though there is nothing 
you can do some relationships just arent 

meant to work out ere is no comfort 

in hearing that sentiment we all know 

that but sadly its the truth sometimes 

the only thing we can do is accept the 

break and try to work through it eating a 

bucket of ice cream and chocolate during a 

netix marathon usually does the trick 
it 
doesnt matter the gender  it works for 

everyone

orfboard games have undergone an astro
nomical amount of change over the years 
when board games were rst introduced 
with titles like monopoly and scrabble it 

consisted of four players all competing against 
each other to achieve one given goal to win 

since then games have evolved to a point 
where the ultimate 

end goal is dierent 

and the journey 
there is almost 
unrecognizable 
comparative to old 
games 
nowadays 
board games allow 
players to work 
together to take 
down one player 
to form temporary 

allies to gain an 
advantage or even 
to work towards 

various objectives 
in order to achieve 
victory 
one of the prime examples of the way 
board games have developed into something 

completely new is dead of winter 
a cross

roads game
e world has gone to chaos as a zombie 
outbreak has ravaged the planet you and one to 
four of your closest friends have all survived the 
outbreak forced to survive on what you can get 
in dead of winter you and your friends 
work together to achieve one ultimate goal 

which is randomly selected between a number 

of options ese goals can range from killing 
a given number of zombies to traversing the 
ravaged land in search of a better shelter 

apart from the primary objective each player 
has a secondary objective that the rest of the 

players dont know about ey can be simple 
tasks like getting a certain amount of food to 
aid to the teams survival or they can be devi

ous such as sabotaging the rest of the team 
for your own personal gain or victory ese 
objectives provide an abundance of variety to 
every game making it so no game is like the 

one before
while 
i only played two games 
i was on 
the edge of my seat both times 
it was an 
adventure as 
i was trying to determine what 
everyone elses ulterior motives were in the 

campaign aspect of the game ere was a 
game where almost 
everyone survived 

the objective with 
only one person 
being devoured by 
zombies 
another 
time we all faced 
our imminent 
demise being be
trayed by someone 

we thought was 
our friend who 

ultimately died 
of starvation e 
game provides 

twists and turns 
that take the play
ers o guard and forces them to change their 

strategy at every given opportunity to make 
sure they dont fail in their objective
e bleak montana winter is coming and 
what better way to avoid it than simulating 

zombieravaged winter in board game form 
with some of your closest friends dead of 
winter will bring all of your friends together 

to survive a zombie apocalypse and possibly 
drive one friend away as he steadily betrays 
you all 
all in all when the weather gets too 
cold as it tends to get in montana get some 
hotbuttered rum crowd into a heated apart
ment get ready to ght and play dead of 
winter you wont regret it 
you can get dead of winter at rooks 
comics and games across from the mall or 
on 
amazon 
it costs between 4560 while 
that may seem a bit pricey it provides enough 
fun to make it worth it
ofine zombie survival
in dead of 
winter you 
and your friends work 
together to achieve one 
ultimate goal which is 
randomly selected between 
a number of options these 
goals can range from killing 
a given number of zombies 
to traversing the ravaged 
land in search of a better 
shelter
many nd 
that the 
shortterm 
longdistance 
relationship 
isnt what 
they signed 
up for and 
they often 
cant handle 
the split
making it through the holidays

   15l  callandmarksthe most erotic shopping 
trip youve ever had
by jul
iana
 hartis year marks eight years since 
erotique opened in downtown 
bozeman previously erotique was 

known as miss 
kittys 
adult store 
between the two a sex store has 

resided in bozeman for 33 years 

this year
miss 
kittys was opened in 1981 
to much outrage because at the 

time sex wasnt quite so openly 

presented and discussed as it is 

now despite the uproar it survived 
and come 1984 billy mcwilliams 
started working a part time job 

there just three years later in 1987 

he became manager he stayed in 
that position for 20 years and once 
miss 
kittys shut down mcwil
liams took over and renamed the 

store erotique in 2007
mcwilliams had couples in 
mind when he created erotique 
he got rid of the porn view
ing booths and gave the store a 
makeover erotique has a friendly 

and welcoming atmosphere now 
it 
is a nonjudgmental environment 

where shame and embarrassment 

do not exist while miss 
kittys 
was a malecentric shop erotique 
is a more femaleandcouple 

friendly store
erotique is even better than 
online shopping though that 
might seem easier e physical 
store setting of erotique gives you 

something that online shopping 

never could 
an actual store set
ting allows you to see what you 

want in real life with real dimen
sions not just some at image on a 

computer screen shopping in the 
store allows a feeling that online 

never will moreover someone is 
in the store to help and give you 
advice if necessary
e store has a wide range of 
products for everyone from bach
elor and bachelorette party favors 

to whips and handcus e stores 

biggest selection of products is 
of course dildos and vibrators for 
anyone out there who need a little 

selflovin ey also carry a fairly 

diverse assortment of lingerie and 

have a bdsm section is section 
is lled with fun and safe items 
like fuzzy handcus ball gags 

riding crops bondage rope and lu
bricants erotique oers the basic 
water and silicone based lubes as 
well as lubricants made with vegan 

and organic ingredients
mcwilliams said cultural ac
ceptance of sex has come so far 

in the community after all these 
years that the stigma associated 
with it has significantly dropped 

he stated that having both ero
tique and miss 
kittys in town 
has contributed to the building 
of the community 
it has allowed 
the public to open itself up to 
acceptance and being open about 
sex and sexual things mcwil
liams believes that part of this 

acceptance comes from the access 

we now have to porn and sexual 
images online and on 
tv
 he said 
we have more porn and sexualized 
images now than in the whole of 

humankinds history
unfortunately though there 
is more acceptance sex is still 

suocated by a shame and fear 

based culture 
as easy as it is to 
access things associated with sex 

or sex itself it is still shrouded in 
shame making things dicult for 
those who are confused or want 

information is culture makes 

people unwilling to ask questions 
which is why we then have kids 
who think that they got pregnant 

via a hot tub grinding session and 
people who think you can get 
stds from holding hands or kiss
ing erotique exists in part to help 

promote knowledge and healthier 

attitudes towards sex
mcwilliams said orgasms are 
truth ey are the most honest 

feeling a person can have at 

shouldnt be shamed you have to 
like yourself ats the key to life 
it is freeing to be yourself and like 
yourself to refuse to live in the

filmmaker brings warlords of 
ivory to procrastinator
by 
keeg
an

ady
if traveling in wartorn areas taking 
covert video or defending dangerous 
animals sounds like fun to you you may 

have a problem 
if all three sound like good 
career choices you may work for 
national 
geographic
on friday afternoon on the procras
tinators screen investigative journal
ist bryan christy was setting off on a 

personal warpath against some of the 

most dangerous criminals in the world 

 ivory poachers he began in the shop 

of a master taxidermist who was mak
ing him a fake elephant tusk 
into this 
tusk a nearperfect replica of real ivory 

was put a stateoftheart gps tracker 

the idea was simple if the poachers take 
the tusk the tusk will reveal where the 

poachers are 
the rest of the film fol
lowed christys journey as he faced suspi

cious government authorities dangerous 

criminals and thousands of families torn 

apart by ivorydriven violence but as 
spectacular as christys journey was the 

procrastinator was full of people for the 

man behind the camera  filmmaker 

john heminway
warlords of 
ivory marked the culmi
nation of a long career  from television 

to marketing consultant to author of six 

books heminways life has been one of 

a thousand titles but the title he is most 

known for is that of filmmaker 
and 
strangely enough he almost wasnt in the 

film business 
it was an accident he said chuckling 
wryly he reckoned it started with the same 

schoolboy hunger we all have for a good 

yarn what 
i was always drawn by was the 

story he said 
i was lucky to sit at the feet 

of some great storytellers in my life and 

im still learning how to do it 
that learn
ing has carried him across the globe but 
most often it has taken him back to one 

place  
africa
he describes his love for the continent as 
an overbearing attraction 
after a school 
trip he found himself enchanted by the 

vast lands he encountered 
and so he kept 
returning 
three books and two 
national 
geographic specials on 
africa had to hap
pen before warlords of 
ivory was made 
but the final result is a powerful film 
though heminway claimed he avoids 
advocacy films he also acknowledged 
its 
clear were on the side of the elephants 

the film is indeed powerful commentary 
on the viciousness of the ivory trade and 

its terrible cost in terms of natural life 

however warlords of 
ivory is surpris
ingly devoid of the animals more than 

simply being about dead elephants it is a 

film about people heminway is well aware 
of that emotional aspect when you read 

about this stuff you can put a natural 

barrier between yourself and the story he 

said 
the film doesnt allow you that luxu
ry 
it dawned on me  that the ivory trade 
is killing people and destroying lives 
this 
is not just a conservation movie  it is a 

movie about the costs of our actions and 

the ways that the world is connected
paul 
theroux the legendary travel 
writer once said of 
africa you go away 
for a long time and return a different per
son  you never come all the way back 
it 
seems john heminway would agree 
there 
comes a time when it is not enough to 

make a beautiful film he said staring out 

into a crowd of young faces somewhere 

there was a change from reporting on the 

world to changing the world 
in film stud
ies you learn that an essential element of 

any story is conflict the world is seldom 

pure beauty or pure tragedy 
as the crowd 

filed out of the theater there was an air of 

solemn contemplation  but it was an air 

tinged with hope
there comes a time when it is not enough to make a 
beautiful lm

alex sheen spreads the power of promisesby julie donagan
on monday nov 16 founder of the non
prot organization because i said i would 
alex sheen spoke to a full house in the sub 

ballrooms sheen additionally led a master 
class with a small group of msu students 
earlier in the day and a discussion with about 
50 students following his talk e event was 
sponsored by the msu leadership institute 
and was free for msu students and the 
public
sheen founded because i said i would 
in 2012 aer his father died of lung cancer 

sheen had always been inspired by his fathers 

commitment to his promises and at the 

funeral handed out promise cards with the 
words because i said i would printed on 
them ese cards were intended to inspire 

people to write down and fulll the promises 
they made to themselves and to others he 
also created a facebook group based on the 

idea and the movement went viral sheen 

stated in a ted talk he gave in utica new 

york that in 2013 promise cards had already 
been distributed to 48 countries
founding a social movement and a non
prot organization was dierent path from 

what sheen had originally planned for him
self graduating from ohio university in 
2007 with a bachelors degree in marketing 

sheen focused mainly on market research 
and worked for a soware company aer 
graduation in college sheen was a member 

of the lacrosse team and a part of the col
legiate entrepreneurs organization i had 

ambitions to be an entrepreneur in a far dif

ferent respect sheen said in fact i didnt 

actually even know how nonprots worked 
i was so oblivious to the social sector it was 
in no way a part of my vision for life but 

the skillset of being in business and entre
preneurship helped me start the nonprot 

which is in so many ways the same 
sheen said he has grown  as a person since 
because i said i would was launched both 
in maintaining his image and in aiming to 
live like his father i was not a man of my 
word before ive changed a lot fundamen
tally trying to be the person people think i 

am people expect you to show up on time 
every time ere are no excuses
while sheen was in college social media 
was just taking o sheen said that 20 years 

ago because i said i would probably 
would not have existed social media 
denitely has a place in life it brings aware
ness to really important issues that people 
were oblivious to prior to its existence he 

also stated that social media is especially 
important for nonprots and something 
they should utilize even more to spread 

their message he added that we should 
think of it as storytelling rather than social 

media
sheen is currently aiming to create 
because i said i would chapters around 
the world to take the movement beyond an 
individual level and to make an even greater 
impact one person can make such a dif

ference one committed individual but now 
imagine so many coming together to do the 
same thing chapters are going to be a huge 
part of how the movement spreads we need 
people doing things organized structure so 
you can be a part of the movement in a way 

thats beyond independent action sheen 
said
in sheens opinion the consequences 
of breaking a promise are permanent and 

harsh and that the world as a whole needs to 
improve in following through with prom
ises its really sad that we live in a society 

that when you say promises and politicians 
in the same sentence people chuckle ey 
run the world and when theyre not good 
at fullling their commitments i think that 
says something about society as a whole 
according to sheen while second chances 
are important once trust is lost all is lost

a new species of duckbill dinosaur 
discovered by msu professor and 
adjunct teacher elizabeth fowler 
was showcased on nov 11 in a paper 
published by the scientic journal 

plos one e paper was written 
by fowler along with msu paleon
tologist jack horner and reveals that 
the new species named 
probrachlo
phosaurs bergei
 is an evolutionary 

link between two previously discov
ered species of dinosaur
e dinosaur lived 79 million years 
ago and lived on the oodplains of 

prehistoric montana it was a variety 

of hadrosaur popularly known as 

duckbilled dinosaurs due to their 

broad ducklike snout and reached 
up to 30 feet in length and weighed 
ve tons when fully grown natural 

predators of the 
probrachylophosaurus 

included small packhunting raptors 

and an early relative of the 
tyranno

saurus rex
according to fowler the species 
is an ancestor of 
brachylophosaurus
 which lived 77 million years ago 

and is also a direct descendant of an 
earlier species called 
acristavus
 which 
lived 81 million years ago making 
probrachylophosaurus
 a missing link 

between the two previously discov
ered species
e dinosaurs species name 
bergei
 is a tribute to landowner sam berge 

who passed away in 1999 berges 
three children own the land where 
the fossil digs are located e speci

men was uncovered on the super
duck site so named because of the 

large size of the new species located 
north of rudyard mt
bones of the 
probrachylophosaurus
 were originally discovered in 1981 
by a crew from the university of 

california museum of paleontology 

in berkeley
ey just found a couple leg bones 
and part of the pelvis coming out and 

they didnt really see much else they 

werent there for dinosaurs they were 

there for mammals fowler said ey 

came back in 1992 they got a couple 

more bones but they never found any 

skull material and skull material is 

what we need for identifying species
in 2007 jack horner returned to 
the site and he observed some newly 
discovered bones that students had 
found were part of a skull fowler and 

her crew moved from a nearby site in 

order to begin excavating the fossils 
e team spent the summers of 
2007 and 2008 digging at the site and 

were able to collect most of the skull 
along with all of the pelvis and most 

of the hind legs as well as ribs and 

vertebrae but were not able to nd 

the forearms of the animal
once the specimen had been re
turned to the lab for examination the 

team discovered that the skull had a 
unique nasal crest much smaller than 
the crests of similar species and from 
this were able to determine they were 
working with a new species fowler 

and horner began work on the paper 
detailing the discovery 
since the publication of the paper 
the discovery has attracted attention 
from various media outlets including 
discovery channel yahoo science 
news christian science monitor 
reuters and the billings gazette
it has gotten really good press cov
erage so far weve been very pleased 
by it fowler said
in the future fowler hopes to con
tinue to study and catalog potential 
new species is is kind of the end 
of this project but theres always spin
o projects we have other fossils 
from the same area that need to be 
described both duckbills and other 
animals living at the same time so 

we have a lot more new species le to 

come in the near future she said
as for the 
probrachylophosaurs
 the 
specimen will continue to reside at 

the museum of the rockies ough 
there are no immediate plans to ex
hibit the 
probrachylophosaurus
 at the 
museum fowler hopes to eventually 
have an exhibit featuring 
probrachy
lophosaurs
 brachylophosaurus
 and 
acristavus
 together i would love to 
make a display case with the three of 
them showing the evolution all in 
order  thats still in my future plans 
fowler said

students are often faced with trou
bling news when they violate the student 
code of conduct at msu however ed 
mckenna director of student conduct 

explained that the process does not have 
to be intimidating instead it can be help
ful to student growth
 as with any successful institution 
abiding by certain responsibilities is a 
necessity to that institutions success and 

students at a university are no different 
however mckenna understands what 
its like to be part of the process because 
he wants to change students lives and 
work with students in a more oneon

one setting as his own life was changed 
by a universitys conduct process
mckenna remarked that hes not 
afraid to share that he went through his 
universitys conduct process and that 
it was the most influential experience 
in his life he said that instead of the 
process being punitive he was given the 

opportunity to join the program and 
one of the out
comes changed his 
life
the office of the 
dean of students 
is trying to help 
develop students 

through different 
means than pun
ishment instead 

they are focused on 
responsibility and 

as mckenna said discussions dont deal 
with guilty not guilty its responsible 
not responsible nonetheless the code of 

conduct is certainly something to 
be taken seriously
mckenna stressed that while 
theres one conduct program 

there are different entry 
points athletics fam
ily and grad housing 

office of institutional 
equity and resi
dence life into the 

conduct process  

but theres one uni
fied code of con
duct that students 
have to abide by 

or work within
it may seem like 
the code of conduct 

only applies to on 
campus events or 
events directly associ

ated with facets of the 
school but the office of 
the dean of students are also 

in contact with campus police 
and the bozeman police if they are con
tacted by the bozeman police then they 
can get involved because as mckenna 

says they have jurisdiction to work with 

students even if it is off campus and 

they often will if they feel it is in the best 

interest of the student
mckenna emphasized that students be 
proactive about understanding the code 

of conduct because the university has a 
vested interest in the wellbeing safety and 
conduct of students on and off campus
student codes of conduct can seem 
like a means of inhibiting the growth 
of a student especially if they are the 
one involved in the process but taking 

responsibility for actions helps to show 

that these processes are necessary in the 

development of students who may be 

struggling with academic and life issues
ultimately mckenna said that the code 
of conduct is really all about development 

whether its moral development or ethical 
he wants to ask stu
dents how their ac
tions not only aect  
success  but how do 

they aect the com
munity students are 

part of a greater com
munal existence and 

it is their responsibil
ity to contribute to 

the community and 
take care of themselves as well

xenophobic response to paris attacks is misguided
like much of the rest of the world i 
watched with horror as the attacks in 
paris unfolded on friday nov 13 like 

many on campus i knew fellow students 

studying in france and had friends 

in paris e initial attacks 

consisting of coordinated suicide 

bombings mass shootings and 

hostage taking le at least 136 

dead and 352 injured
aer the initial shock and 
confusion the world responded 

famous monuments around the 

globe were lit in the blue white 

and red of frances ag as a show 

of solidarity and numerous world leaders 

oered their sympathies and support
since the initial outpouring of support 
however another response has surfaced 

equally as misguided as the rst response 

was touching a disturbingly large number 

of americans have responded to the attacks 

with xenophobia and islamophobia calling 

on president obama to stop accepting syr
ian refugees
while these people mean well and are act
ing in good faith for what they believe is the 

greatest good of the country there is little 

doubt that they are mistaken e decision 
to harbor refugees or turn them 

away is not simple but it is con
nected to the paris attacks
at the time of publication the 
majority of those responsible for 

the atrocities in paris have been 

identied ey were nearly unan
imously european nationals and 

do not appear to be connected to 

the syrian refugees despite what 

some may say out of ignorance 
or desire for political gain the wall street 

journal says that numerous studies going 

back more than a century have shown that 

immigrants  regardless of nationality or 

legal status  are less likely than the native 

population to commit violent crimes or to 

be incarcerated
e us has already allowed more than 
2000 syrian refugees eeing their countrys 

civil war safe haven within its borders an
other 10000 are scheduled to be brought in 

over the coming year despite the presence 

of thousands of refugees from syria and 

elsewhere in the middle east however e 

atlantic recently reported that most lethal 

political violence since sept 11 has come in 

the form of attacks by white supremacists 

antigovernment extremists and the like 

by nearly a twotoone ratio dylann roof 

the blondhaired white supremacist who 

confessed to attacking an africanamerican 

church and shooting nine is a more accurate 

picture of terrorism in the us than anyone 

from outside its borders
ere are reasonable justications to not 
want additional syrian refugees within the 

us e belief that they will pose a credible 

threat to american safety however is simply 

without merit all current evidence points 

to the opposite and we as a nation would do 

well to remember that
responding to the attacks in paris with 
calls to shut down mosques or close our 

borders as some politicians have done or 

otherwise attacking the muslim population 
plays into isiss hands it makes the united 

states seem uncaring towards those in need 

and alienates potential muslim allies in our 

ght against isis
do not vote for fearmongers who would 
promise safety in return for the civil liberties 

of some as rights in the us are supposed to 

be inalienable do not treat any students 

on campus from abroad any dierently than 

you would have before fridays attacks as 

they are almost certainly as horried as 

anyone else at msu instead remember a 

sense of compassion for those who have ed 

from war and have nowhere to return to 

remember e statue of liberty stands on 

our eastern border greeting arrivals with the 

words
give me your tired your poor

your huddled masses yearning to breathe 
free

    7socore curriculum hardcore costs students suer superuous system
the costs of attending msu have in
creased over the past decade annual 
tuition rates for undergraduate residents 
have grown by 1000 since 

2008 while nonresident rates 
have increased by over 5000 
additionally room and board 
rates are nearing 9000 over
all resident and nonresident 

undergraduate students this 
year are spending an estimated 
average of 20099 and 35331 
respectively college is impracti

cally expensive and burdens students with 

unreasonably high amounts of debt that 
leaves little desire to remain in college any 
longer than necessary naturally students 

want to get in and out of college quickly 

with minimal detours however a mul
titude of requirements must be fulfilled 
before any student can leave msu with a 
degree for example students must waste 
countless hours trying to pass courses 

outside of their major
msu is federally obligated to provide 
its students a liberal and practical educa
tion as well as broaden their cultural 

horizons what this entails is requiring 

students to take specific courses regard
less of their majors to meet these obliga
tions but just how effective is this style of 

education through msus common core 

curriculum core 20 an engineering 

student may be tasked with learning music 
theory or the ethics surrounding good 
and evil while an aspiring artist would be 
required to interpret contemporary litera
ture or statistics a mathematician would 
hardly find benefit in attending a philoso
phy course from a students per
spective most core courses are 
nothing more than highpriced 
hindrances in the universitys 
eyes core 20 has purpose to 
ensure a wideranging general 
education regardless of how 
the core curriculum is perceived 
it is undesired among students 
hardly anyone hires a taxi to 
take the most indirect circuitous route 

to their destination yet students are left 
without choice in adding 30 credits of 
core courses to their workload
core curriculums also place certain 
students in disadvantageous positions 

a humanities student may struggle in 

science courses due to an overall lack of 

interest motivation or even understand
ing as it may not come as naturally to 

a student of the humanities field as it 

would a student with a scientific mind
set similarly a sciences student may fail 

to perform in a humanities course the 

students grades and finances then suffer 

should a student be unable to acquire a 

c in any core 20 course they would not 

get credit and that class would not fulfill 

the core 20 requirement the concept is 

rather absurd when considering punish
ing a botanist for their inability to write 

creative nonfiction
there are successful alternatives to 
the core curriculum educational system 
though for example students could just 

focus on their majors and graduate earlier 

universities in the united kingdom do 

not generally maintain a core curricu
lum and thus their students are able to 

graduate in three years a shorter college 
experience would be a quite welcomed 
choice in the united states given that the 
average graduate of 2015 has over 35000 

of debt making our generations students 

the most indebted in our countrys his

tory is adding a fourth year of college 

for core courses to broaden cultural 

horizons really worth drawing another 

loan yes when considering it is actually a 
necessity in completing applied homeless
ness courses

who needs sleep not  you sleep is for the weak
after long hours of contemplation one 
will realize that its not worth spend
ing much time sleeping think about it 
if someone said you had to give 
33 percent of your paycheck to 
the government youd say that 

is ridiculous this generation 
is starting to understand that 
spending a third of their lives 

not doing anything is just a waste 

of time 
many of us are fulltime 
students and that means a lot 

of hours in and out of the classroom still 

few of us are actually graduating with 

fouryear degrees solution max out at 21 
credits load up on instant coffee and get 
ready to study in just three years youll 
have two bachelors degrees with a span
ish minor 
there are people out there 
like teenagers and freshmen who 

do nothing but sleep all the time 
theres a reason the dropout 

rate is 50 percent people arent 
taking life seriously theyre 
just happy sleeping through it 

no matter how many 200 level 

buddhism classes you take you 
only have one life so you might as well be 

awake for it 
do you know who sleeps babies thats 
who were not babies were college stu
dents so we better start acting like it
sometimes you lie in bed at night and 
think about all those things you could 

be doing imagining all the homework 

you could get done so theres no morning 
rush the only cure doctors have found 
for this is adderall and since drug abuse 

is bad instead try coffee as a replacement 
for sleep after just one night with this 
method youre guaranteed to get your 

homework actually done and still have the 

time catch up on those readings for econ 
class add another night and youve got 
that midterm paper done a week early and 

had so much more time that you actually 
watched something on netflix instead of 

just browsing it
soon youre ve days deep in sleep depriva
tion your eyes have become weights youre 

walking around the snowy streets at night in 

a foggy delirium youve attempted cutting 
your reading list in half but only made it 30 
pages into war and peace because there were 

too many characters and youve browsed 
through every faceboook photo of people 
you went to high school with
conclusion there is no benefit to sleep
ing ive only presented a few of the won
derful things you can do when you dont 

sleep the world is yours dont let sleep get 

in the way of that

by davis connelley
its been an underwhelming year for the 
montana state bobcats on the other hand 
its been one of surpassing expectations for 
the university of montana grizzlies on 
saturday nov 21 the two teams will clash 
each with plenty to play for e cats will 
try to play spoiler to the grizzlies playo 
hopes while the griz will look to secure their 
playo position
led by superstar quarterback dakota 
prukop but dragged down by an inexperienced 
defense it has been an upanddown year for 
msu prukop a junior has thrown for 25 
touchdowns and ran for 10 more in his second 
year as the starter and signal caller but despite 
a prolic and seniorladen oense the cats are 
even aer 10 games at 55 e biggest reason 
for this is a lack of consistency boasting a 
mediocre record they have irted with great
ness and bottomdwelling from game to game 
oen even within the same drive
laden with experience and poise oen
sively the defense has been a story of one step 
forward two steps back playing well for the 
most part at home including solid defensive 
performances against sacramento state and 
cal poly the defense early in the season was 
completely absent for road games giving up 
55 49 and 59 points in their rst three road 
games all against big sky competition the 
cats fell behind in the playo race early but 
it was their fourth road game a late october 
contest against north dakota that put the 
nail in the con in many ways a microcosm 
for the cats season the up and down game 
ended despite a comeback attempt with a 
heartbreaking loss that eliminated the cats 
from playo consideration 
e bobcats can change that narrative this 
saturday e team has played well the last two 
weeks including a dominant road win against 
idaho state perhaps proving to themselves that 
they can win games from start to nish with 
another complete performance msu has a real 
shot at returning the brawl of the wild trophy 
to bozeman
on the other hand the grizzlies are also 
trending upward aer a wild win in overtime 
against idaho state two weeks ago they also 
defeated eastern washington last weekend 
soundly beating the powerhouse 5516 rid
ing on the shoulders of true freshman jeremy 

calhouns three rst half touchdown scampers 
the griz answered a lot of questions about their 
oense 
on saturday the legitimacy of the improve
ments for both teams will be truly tested e 
strong bobcat oense will try and dismantle the 
stout griz defense and the improved defense 
of montana state will try and slow down the 
resurgent montana oense always a tough 
battle the trenches will likely be the keys to the 
game once the cats get rolling with the run 

game they will be incredibly dicult to contain 
but defensively they will have to apply pressure 
on the grizzly passing game by stopping the run 
and making u of m qb brady gustafson beat 

them if they dont want the game to turn into yet 

another shootout 
montana state has been very good at home 
this season and with everimproving play from 
the defense the cats will nd out a lot about 
the direction of their program during the game 
with pride on the line and the opportunity to 

put the grizzlies on the outside track for a play
o spot montana state should be able to use 

their homeeld advantage to bring the trophy 

back to bozeman
by will hamel
in college sports there are few 
things more cherished than a strong 
bitter rivalry from catgriz to ohio 

statemichigan to auburnalabama 

the rivalry game plays a role in 
bringing exposure to a program from 
people who otherwise wouldnt care 

games are remembered fondly and 

bitterly and oen signicant games 

and plays are given names to enhance 
the lore of the moment such as e 
kick and e streak for catgriz 

rivalries bring a sort of intensity un
seen in any other game but despite 
that these games are meant to be 
enjoyed in good fun
 sadly we can all recall that one 
grizzly or bobcat fan who went too 
far rivalry games are not immune 
from the whims of those who take 

their passion too far to cause actual 

tangible damage a casual outsider 

might look at these instances and 
wonder if such games are worth it
as a bobcat fan who was born 
and raised during e streak i 
would denitely say yes these games 
are worth it while at a young age 

i would get the occasional pointed 
comment about my team by and 
large the game was a way for me to 

bond with other fans who held a simi

lar passion as i did regardless of the 
side is i think is best exemplied 
with my relationship with my former 

boss but eternal friend of anyone who 

met him robert nordstrom
bob nordstrom was born on 
may 25 1943 in chester montana 

he was the only child of bert and 

anna nordstrom who held a hope 

that their son would one day run 
the family business roosevelt 
service a gas station and car shop 

in chester aer attending college 

at northern montana college now 
msunorthern and the university 
of montana he married his soul
mate barbara anderson in 1966 

aerwards he returned home and 

took over the family business where 
he and his business became a town 
mainstay over the next 50 years
growing up mr nordstrom was 
always a friend as a baby i knew 

him as the father of my babysitters 

he and barb had three daughters 
at least one of whom changed a 
number of my diapers i also knew 

him as the friendly gas station boss 

and neighbor whenever we stopped 
at his gas station hed always give my 
brother and i free candy which is 

something he did for all the children 

of customers as a neighbor he had 

these apple trees in his back yard that 
produced the smallest sour apples 
youd ever eat but they were delicious 

and he didnt mind if when walking 

by we picked one for the road
as a college student i knew him 
as my boss coming into the sum
mer 2011 i was in desperate need 

of employment i called up mr 
nordstrom asked if he had an open
ing and he accepted me on the spot 
easiest job interview ever
looking back im still surprised 
he hired me mainly because i was 
the least qualied person for the job 
i had very little experience with cars 

and people who know me know im 
by no means mechanical is did 

not faze him as he and his fellow 

coworker duane aitken were more 
kind and patient with me than i de
served i must have xed and replaced 
hundreds of truck tires that summer 

which was a big part of roosevelt 
services business and something i 
had never done but he had faith in 

people and that faith had an eect on 

those who knew him
but this brings me to my main 
point mr nordstrom was a huge 

grizzly fan his red pickup with 

grizzly plates may have been as 

synonymous with him as his busi
ness more oen than not whenever 
we talked football would inevitably 

be brought up and a causal one 

minute conversation would turn into 
a spirited ten minute conversation 
en wed laugh and hed tell me to 

get back to work
catgriz was not insignicant in 
the role it played in our friendship 
while anyone will tell you that mr 
nordstrom could be friends with 

anyone the intensity and importance 
of the rivalry gave us more than 

simple conversation it was a way to 

bond a common language is is a 
truth that is not exclusive to us
last year i got a call that mr nord
strom had passed away i was shocked 
even though i knew he was having 
medical problems mainly because he 
had been such a constant part of my 

life and the lives of others in chester
 is was four days before last 
years cat griz game when the game 
nally came and the griz built their 
insurmountable 340 lead i couldnt 

help but smile because i knew that ol 

mr nordstrom would have never let 
me hear the end of it i could imagine 
him smiling and saying boy we got 

you good this year en hed give me 

a candy to cheer me up
so heres to you mr nordstrom 
while you and i probably would 

have been friends no matter what 

ill always feel that catgriz played 

a major part in friendship and im 
thankful it was there to help solidify 
that and hopefully well get you 

back this year

catgriz grizcat 
bueller anyone
ere are few rivalry names as descriptive 
and succinct as catgriz in merely two 
syllables the name adequately describes the 
event in question its a game between the 

bobcats and the grizzlies conveniently con
densed for all not only is it well made its 

fun to say e name starts strong with the 

ka sound thats a biting call for attention 
while ending with a satisfying zz sound 
thus encapsulating both strength and cool 

its a great name for a great game
 so it only makes sense that some grizzly 
fans are trying to mess it up
i dont know when it all started but over 
time ive seen a concerted by the hardcore 

grizzly fans to turn the beautiful catgriz 
name into the confusing contorted name 
grizcat in my opinion this change 

is roughly on par with some of historys 
worst changes that include new coke the 

dodgers moving to los angeles and craig 
ferguson leaving late night television
when i was growing up instead of 
growing out all of my grizzly friends called 

the game catgriz ey justied this by 
saying it simply sounds better besides the 

cats need to be rst in something is was 
the age of dickinson ah yat and edwards 
making the critique tough but fair
nowadays this is starting to change 
amongst the grizzly faithful to combat 

this ive devised a series of foolproof argu
ments except for the fool who wrote them 

that will prove once and for all that catgriz 

is the superior name
first its alphabetized correctly roughout 
the course of human history the default order 

for a list of names is typically alphabetical its 
certainly what i grew up with in school
bruener ian
here

connelley davis

here

hamel will

here

uh  would you mind if you werent

i suppose if were going to do away with 
the alphabetized structure of catgriz we 

may as well do away with the alphabetized 

structure of the phone book bonus points if 

you nd the secret hidden message
foiterson fry

adamson udell

robinson nancy

omson nathan

sampson yelena

second grizcat to me sounds way more 
like a failed barney spino than the name of 

a treasured rivalry game
hiya kids its me grizcat today were 
gonna learn about the letter f
hey grizcat i got an f word for ya
e sixyearold kids begin swearing 
and pelting the costumed performer with 

sharp rocks rotten vegetables ypound 

cinderblocks and free dvd copies of e 

lone ranger
lastly according to my superscientic bi
asfree maynothavereallyoccurred survey 

of 30 grizzly fans in the area catgriz was 

the most answered response to the question 

what do you call the montana  montana 

state game
catgriz 23

grizcat 2

will chew your food 5

clearly with this mountain of evidence 
and opinions as free of bias as fox news 

my point is irrefutable but if you need addi

tional evidence consider the following quote 

i might have found on the internet from 

franklin delano roosevelt during his time at 

the yalta conference
its called catgriz

how can anyone argue with that on second 
thought  feel free to call it whatever you want
by will hamelathlete profile 
taylor sheridan the grizturnedcat
by will hamel
e fact that defensive tackle and team cap
tain taylor sheridan came back to montana 
to continue his football career by playing di

vision i football was probably not a surprise to 

those who knew him  aer all the littleton 

colorado product had actually spent most of 

his childhood in montana living in missoula 

until seventh grade and spending his fresh
man year of high school at bozeman high  
what may have come as a surprise was the 
montana school he chose
my whole family and i were grizzly fans  
which is funny to this day sheridan said
aer earning allleague honors at rock can
yon high school sheridan got looks and interest 

from colorado colorado state and a host of 

division ii schools in colorado but it was the 

bobcats interest from the start coupled with a 
desire to play division i football that put sheri
dan on the path to his former childhood rivals
ey oered me from day one ese guys 
were honest from day one in how much they 

wanted me it was huge for me to come back 

and just be two hours from so much family
his family was happy to follow suit

its cool to see how much my family has 
converted from grizzly to bobcat fans my 

grandparents were awesome they were season 

ticket holders for the griz forever but as soon 

as i signed here my grandpa traded everything 
in and started wearing blue and gold
aer redshirting his freshman year 
sheridan saw plenty of playing time both 
on defense and on special teams  originally 

slated to play defensive end sheridan moved 

inside to defensive tackle when the need arose 

and hasnt le the position since
i moved down into defensive tackle 
because we had so many injuries i was behind 

zach minter and taylor dees and then 
minter got hurt my redshirt freshman year 
and then i started playing when i got here i 
thought i was going to be a defensive end but 

i actually like the way it turned out
e move paid o for sheridan who played 
defense and special teams in nearly every game 

his rst two years sheridan became the teams 

permanent starter at defensive tackle in 2014 

and played an important role in getting that 

team to last years playos in 2015 sheridan 

was the teams only returning starter for a 

defense that this year has utilized so many 
freshman and sophomores the senior sheri
dan found himself in a leadership role
as sheridan prepares to play his nal 
game for the bobcats against the grizzlies 

hell make sure that his guys are ready and 

motivated
i think if i was addressing the team from 
the start i would denitely tell them the con
ference championship denitely means more 

but when it becomes catgriz week id tell 
them i was lying because catgriz is huge
even though sheridans career at montana 
state will end following catgriz he still has 
an eye on what this game would mean for the 

bobcats future seasons
when we beat the griz it gives everyone 
that good taste of the season e momentum 

and positivity carries over for these guys when 

they work out over the summer and into next 

season its huge we denitely have to win it

its around that time again the snow 
sticks and the skiers get stoked out of their 
minds to shred any tiny amount they can 

nd yet it is also the time when another 

sport gets more and more exciting ice 

climbing while not nearly as popular of a 

winter sport as skiing or as rock climbing 
in terms of climbing ice climbing is a sport 
that the locals of montana love it is also 

completely insane and ludicrous and youre 

probably better o going skiing than trying 

to get involved with ice climbing
 first and foremost ice climbing is ter
rifying and only for those with a screw 
loose in their head because the rst rule of 
ice climbing is you dont fall or rather you 
cant fall you are not allowed to fall with 
rock climbing especially sport climbing 

whipping the act of taking a big fall is 

completely acceptable people even say 

that if you arent falling then you arent 

trying things hard enough and should get 

on something just to whip ice climbing 

however is dierent falling results almost 
always in injury ose spikey feet things 
and spikey axes are out to kill you if you 

fall while whipping a crampon will most 

likely get caught on the ice stopping its fall 

while you keep going resulting in a broken 

ankle or two or those spikes can gouge out 

a piece of meat from your legs or the ice 

screws keeping your rope attached to the 
ice wont hold and youll fall to the ground 
so basically ice climbing means no falling 

without severe consequences erefore it 

is insane and extremely dangerous
ice climbing is also prohibitively expen
sive while a good old sport climbing set 

up will cost you maybe 400 ice climbing 
barely bats an eye at that kind of money 
e gear required for ice climbing goes as 
follows mountaineering boots ice tools 
crampons ice screws quickdraws rope 

half ropes are preferable and a lot of warm 

clothing e boots cost at least 500 the 

tools about 300 per tool and you need 
two crampons are 200 ice screws set you 
back 60 per screw you need at least six 
to fourteen quickdraws are roughly 115 
for six half ropes are 200 each and two 

are required basically ice climbing means 

you can kiss your life goodbye to pay for 

all of these pokey things paying rent not 

possible if youre buying ice climbing gear 

to recap so far weve basically learned ice 
climbing is extremely terrifying and all 

that terror costs a couple of kidneys to buy 
sounds like fun right
it gets worse though luckily ice climb
ing has another component to it that truly 
knocks it out of the safe waters and into the 

mental ward swimming pool if that pool 

also had sharks in it ere is an aspect of 

ice climbing called the screaming bares 
lovely name isnt it e screaming bares 
are basically what they sound like while 

climbing holding the ice tools above ones 

head for an extended period of time the 

blood stops reaching the hands is causes 

ones hands to become very cold aer 

climbing when the hands come down to 
ones side as opposed to being elevated that 
blood starts to come back into the extremi
ties oh nice you might think that must 
warm the hands up yes yes it does in 

the most painful and horribly imaginable 

way your hands slowly warm up from this 

it hurts its an unavoidable pain that is 

so severe it causes one to moan and feel 

nauseous 
it makes you want to throw up it makes 
you want to cut your hands off all the 

while cursing the sport of ice climbing 

whats better is the screaming barfies dont 

really ever go away  they will continue 

to wreak havoc on an ice climbers men
tal stability and cause them to writhe in 

pain my friend mason once got them so 

bad he passed out ive gotten them two 
thirds of the way up an ice climb while 
leading and lost vision because of it it 

lasted for a dreadful fifteen minutes where 

i couldnt see and was trying to throw up 

while stranded in the middle of a frozen 

waterfall which is terrifying because you 

arent allowed to fall ice climbing remem
ber the only plus of the screaming barfies 
is watching other people writhe in agony 
from their malicious pain
ultimately ice climbing is out to kill you 
from either lack of funds to feed yourself 
or attacking you when you fall from all that 

gear you bought from the lack of feeding 
yourself if you survive that far then the 
sport will continue to remind you how 
crappy the experience will be with the 
screaming barfies youre much better off 

going skiing where you dont have to try 

hard with exercise and there isnt a horrible 

thing called the screaming barfies plus 

there are no bridger fries up a freezing cold 

waterfall

    13fun in the winter sun why 
ice shing makes a great date
fishtalesby nick kasseri   breathe life back into 
my cold frozen fingers 
my breath steams in the 
frigid air as it warms my 
hands back up
   just then the tip of my rod 

makes a sharp bounce i hold it 

up to my chest and put my other 
hand on the reel waiting for the 

fish to bite again wait  wa  
pull and the fight is on
ice fishing is my favorite thing 
about winter talk about walking 
on water and since i dont have 
a boat its the only time i get to 

fish a lot of spots on the lakes 
i love being able to stand in the 
middle of a lake and drop a bait 

down into the depths to see what 
i come up with as any fisher
man knows deep water does not 
necessarily mean big fish but 
something about the unknown 
allows me to conjure up images of 
15pound lake trout swimming in 
the watery depths 
and it makes for a great date
its cold sure theres no deny
ing that especially if you dont 

have a shelter i dont care how 

layered up you get or how tough 

you are five hours spent on the 
ice in 20 degree weather with 
nothing to shelter you from the 
wind is cold but its worth it
in todays world of high tech 
dating and hookups of cell phones 
and facebook and tinder its hard 

to go on a real date one that starts 

with i was wondering if i could 
take you to dinner instead of 
whats up wanna hang out go
ing on an actual date and getting 

to know someone face to face is 

getting less common every day ice 

shing can be a great solution to 

many of the problems of modern 

dating you dont have reception 
so the only thing you use your cell 

phone for is taking pictures of the 
sh you catch its quiet so you 
dont have to yell inches from each 
others ear to talk it forces you to 

really communicate face to face 

and get to know each other and 

any girl or guy that agrees to go ice 

shing on a date in the rst place is 
quite a catch
i sit in my american flag lawn 
chair holding my frabill ice rod 
level with my chest pulling up 

to my face and reeling on the 

way back down the auger is a 

yellow hand auger also frabill 

with a five inch bit and ive 
drilled it a little ways into the ice 
so it doesnt fall over and so the 

pictures look cooler a girl who 

will soon become my girlfriend 

sits next to me so i am very fo
cused on not losing this fish i get 

the fish up to the bottom of the 

hole this is where things can get 
dicey if you have too much slack 

in your line the fish will shake 
your hook but if your line is too 
taut and it catches on the edge 
of the hole youve drilled then 

it will break or go slack either 

one means you lose the fish and 

i never want to lose a fish  

especially not with a pretty girl 
watching me
the trick is to not let the fish 
spend any time swimming around 
the bottom of the hole once you 

get them up there let them make 

their last run then pull them 

back into the hole and get them 

out right away right as i pull 
my fish a nice cutthroat to the 
surface her line starts to twitch 

and she pulls back and starts 

reeling soon she has a foot long 

cutthroat of her own flopping 

around in the snow we take 

quick pictures and put them back 

in the water where they swim 
away a little pissed off and with 

an unwanted lip piercing but 
none worse for the wear
we end the day having caught 
27 sh e sun is just starting to 
head towards the horizon as we 

pack up our gear is was her rst 

time ice shing and shes already 

asking about when were coming 
back we had a great date and a 
great time shing and a year later 
we celebrated our rst anniversary 
the next time youre thinking 
about asking someone out think 
about getting to know someone 

on an ice covered lake braving the 

cold bundled up in gloves coats 
and hats and a fishing rod for 
each of you if your date goes well 

you can warm up later with some 

hot chocolate and if it doesnt 

you can still warm yourself up 

later with some hot chocolate 

either way youll often end up 

with quite a catch

teds teton travels buck mountain
by 
theodore
 grover
the tetons arent like any 
other mountain range grand 
teton national park is one of the 
last great wild places le in the 
lower 48 and the mountains 
here embody the adversity and 
untamed natural beauty of the 
american west in a way that no 
other place can 
  nothing describes the ruggedness of the west 

better than the teton crest looming beneath 
the big wyoming sky it is this gru wildness 
that draws thousands of visitors to the tetons 

year aer year including me 
i dont think ill ever forget my rst look 
at the tetons i was 13 years old fresh out of 

seventh grade and on a family trip through 

the western united states it was a gorgeous 

june morning cool and clear with the sun 

just beginning to climb higher in the sky 

e tetons had been socked in the previous 

two days and nally the clouds had broken 
driving along the road heading from jackson 
towards the park we nally passed the big 

blu that blocks the view of the mountains 

from town at was the rst time i saw the 
tetons ey were big bold and beautiful 
on that june morning i never imagined 
that someday i would nd myself skiing 
from the tops of the peaks that presided be
fore me and yet six years later there i was 

standing in a dark parking lot at four in the 
morning about to embark on the toughest 
ski tour of my life our plan was to summit 

and ski buck mountain via its east face 

topping out just shy of 12000 feet buck 

is the tallest mountain in the southern part 

of the teton range its east face is a classic 

double fall line that hangs precipitously 

over a series of large clis 
e sky was just getting light when we ar
rived at the snowline it was only early may 

but the warm temperatures of the winter 

had forced an early retreat of the low eleva
tion snowpack resulting in a miserable mile 
and a half of booting and bushwhacking 
in the dark we promptly switched over to 

skinning as soon as the snowpack warranted 

it we continued to skin until we found 

ourselves approaching the high alpine and 
at that point the whole range began to open 
up around us e snowy grand teton 

stood steadfastly to our north while below 

us signs of spring were spreading through 

the valley but no view captivated us more 

than our fast approaching objective e 

east face of buck now towered over us and 
it was time for the nal summit push 
the east face can be divided into three 
distinct sections the first section is a 
steep couloir that leads up onto the face 

and often remains firm late into the day 

because it receives little sun the second 

section is the face itself this section 
constitutes a doublefall line above the 
aforementioned cliff band it is not steep 

or technical but the consequence of a fall 

on this section is grave the final section 

of the east face is the headwall leading up 

to the summit it is steep and exposed 
we slapped on some crampons at the 
base of the first section and started to 
boot up the face the climb was unevent
ful until we arrived at the headwall lead
ing to the summit there had only been 

a shallow refreeze the night before and 

the snow was warming rapidly the sun 
beat down overhead and although it was 
still early morning things were getting 

hot we dug deep and pushed hard up the 

remaining vertical in a tight race against 

the sun then it was over just like that 
we came up and over the rollover of 
the headwall and found ourselves stand
ing just below the summit we walked the 
short remaining distance until we could 
walk no further wed topped out on the 

summit and what a beautiful summit it 

was the peak of buck is a sharp trian
gular point offering 360 views into the 
heart of the teton range i looked in 
every direction trying to take in as much 

of the view as i could before departing i 

could see snow king and the snake river 

to the south i could even make out the 
distinctive profile of corbets couloir 
and cody bowl it was a view not to be 

forgotten
i couldve sat for hours but it was time 
to get off the face before it got any warm
er we clipped into our skis right on the 

summit and proceeded to ski down to the 
top of the steep headwall i dropped first 
the snow was excellent it was perfect 

buttery corn snow i ripped some steep 

turns down the headwall and proceeded 

to devour the banquet of corn coating the 

middle part of the face its hard to beat 

hero turns down a teton classic upon ar
rival at the couloir that exits the face the 

snow remained firm and icy so we more 

or less straightlined it and came to a halt 

below the mountain i took one last look 

at the east face then turned my tips to 

the fall line and skied back down into the 
valley shredding glorious corn the whole 
way down

appreciation of old celebration of new at bluegrass fest
by raymond porter
e band le the stage with the crowd 
chanting one more song
whether out of a hasty contemplation or 
merely for dramatic pause the lil smokies 
swept back up and performed not one but 
two encore songs to close the ninth annual 

bozeman bluegrass festival at the emerson 
on saturday nov 14 
it all started with the bridger creek boys 
who brought traditional showmanship and 
class playing such classics as john prines 
paradise as well as some of the bozeman

based groups original tunes e group hosts 
the festival each year and celebrated the event 

by handing out free copies of their cd 
matt broughton who plays ddle and 
mandolin is the founding organizer of the 

event broughton originally envisioned the 

festival as multiday event at bridger bowl 
each summer
unfortunately rules prohibit campout 
events broughton said when i rst began 
organizing the event nine years ago the only 
real options were at bars
although the festival is not as grandiose as 
he might have envisioned broughton sees the 

event as a great success since people in the au
dience were feeling an intense amount of joy
e bridger creek boys are the resident 
band of colonel blacks playing every mon
day night at 7 pm according to broughton 
the band is greatly inuenced by bluegrass 
legends like david grisman and bill monroe 
but also rock n roll bands like the rolling 
stones and little feat with a loyal following 
and endless talent the boys rocked the stage
laney lou and the bird dogs followed the 
bridger creek boys with e hollowtops 
delivering the penultimate performance for 
the lil smokies to close out the night 
within the world of bluegrass there are 
some who perceive a conict between old 
and new bridger dunnagan and alex kuo
kov two members of e hollowtops noted 
how some musicians are against the modern 
folk movement e dichotomy between 

truegrasses and newgrasses has gotten a 
lot of press dunnagan commented but i 

think the best bands know how to play and 
respect traditional bluegrass but arent afraid 

to branch out and shake things up 
ere is a sentiment that the new bands 
are harming the bluegrass tradition koukov 

agreed but the best bands are using the 
good parts of every genre all good music has 
similar elements and the tricky part is gur
ing out how to fuse dierent genres together
e hollowtops 
demonstrated the idea 
at the concert by per
forming a bluegrass 
cover of mark ron
sons uptown funk 
driving the listeners 

wild
bluegrass has a 
versatile quiver of 

instruments which 
lets us cover nearly 
everything koukov 
explained we play 

covers of rock n roll 

pop tunes country songs and even some clas
sical pieces
we have played keshas timber and peo
ple loved it dunnagan chimed in covering 
pop and rock songs makes bluegrass palatable 
and available to a larger group of people
e lil smokies also laid down a blue
grass cover of the e 

eagles take it easy 

which had every
one singing along 

e missoula based 

group won the 2015 

telluride bluegrass 

band competition 

and it was easy to see 
with their raw talent 
rened style and 
genuine character
rocky mountain 
bluegrass is a cousin 
of the original appala
chian style broughton said its still acoustic 

string music but a dierent monster bands 

out here like to incorporate rock and pop 

and you heard a lot of that on saturday 
once laney lou and the bird dogs took 
the stage chairs were pushed back and people 

rushed to the front to dance and sing along 

e oor of the soldout event was ooded 

with people and the emerson became 

cramped with listeners and dancers alike 
e bluegrass scene in bozeman is 
quaint kuokov noted there is denitely a 

growing interest though which is encourag
ing
many people take issue with the lack of 
venues in bozeman at the concert it was 
clear that there was not enough space for ev
eryone e dancers got in the way of people 
sitting and at times it was dicult for some 
to hear the band over the sounds of people 
talking and noisy children running
im just one family man turned musician 
broughton said i dont have deep enough 

pockets to get a larger event going but im 

glad we are able to put this event on so every
one can enjoy the music
bluegrass has a versatile 
quiver of instruments 
which lets us cover 
nearly everything 
we 
play covers of rock n roll 
pop tunes country songs 
and even some classical 
pieces

it is important to be aware 
of your sexual rights 
with little age restriction as 
well as no need for parental 

consent montana laws pro
vide students with numerous 

options for sexual care
all of us regardless of age have 
access to birth control prescriptions 
without parental permission these 
prescriptions can be received at msu 
health services bridgercare with 

a slidingscale fee meaning you pay 
what you can afford or from your 
personal physician most insurance 
covers birth control prescriptions 
of all kinds from pills and rings to 
the intrauterine 
device iud 
however 
starting birth 
control after 

intercourse will 

not have an 

effect on the 

outcome this is 

where emergency 

contraception 

comes in the availability of emer
gency contraception to various age 

groups is largely dependent on brand 

pharmacies provide overthecounter 

plan b onestep insurance usually 

covers about half the cost to all ages 

without parental permission while 

next choice next choice one 

dose my way and levonorgestrel 

are prescriptionfree for those over 

the age of 17 the pill ella is avail
able by prescription only regardless 

of age 
whether or not you are currently 
on birth control or have taken emer
gency contraception nothing is ab
solutely foolproof if you think you 
may be pregnant a simple test can be 
picked up at your local grocery store 
or pharmacy or you can make a doc
tors appointment bridgercare offers 

free pregnancy testing and provides 
counseling for all options however 

they do not provide any pregnancy
related services after testing in 
order to stay neutral when discussing 
options 
in the case of pregnancy mon
tana law allows for more options 
than many other states you reserve 
the right to abortion regardless of 

age parental permission has been 
permanently blocked by the courts 

and there is no mandatory waiting 
period medicaid coverage is pro
vided for medically 
necessary abortions
besides watching 
for signs of pregnancy 

another thing to be 
aware of after sexual 

intercourse is the pos
sibility of infection 
msu health services 
bridgercare or your 
personal physician 
can provide sexually transmitted 

infection sti testing using a swab 
blood test and urine sample it is im
portant to receive testing regularly 

since you never know what someone 
may be carrying in their body you 
are not required to get parental 
permission for sti testing most test 
results can be received within a week 
or two the most common sti on 
campus is chlamydia like chlamydia 
many stis do not show symptoms 
so most people are not aware of what 

they are carrying unless they have 
been tested recently

tumbledown house brings 
prohibition to the present
by keegan grady
if you dont like smoky saloons inhab
ited by gangsters and gamblers the ellen 
theatre may have been a little unnerv
ing last friday nov 13 the stage was 

awash in pale red light dancers swung 
gracefully in the aisles welldressed and 
wellgroomed the chandelier sparkled 

in the dim surroundings from the mics 
on stage came the sounds of prohibition 
 the gritty soulful 
and nostalgic music of 
tumbledown house
tumbledown 
house consists of 

vocalist gillian howe 

and guitarist tyler 
miller for shows they 
are joined by regional 

musicians whose 
numbers and instru
ments shift between 

venues for the boze
man show they were 
accompanied by jake 

fleming zac john
son adam greenberg 

and sean lehmann but no matter who ac
companies them the duo drives the show 
 howe and miller mix sultry vocals and 

crisp riffs to recreate an era gone by the 
jazz age is immediately present in their 
music and all the imagery that goes with 

that time  bootlegged liquor murder 
gangsters in three piece suits and smoky 
bars lyrically these themes are clear but 
even more importantly the music itself 
sounds like a 1920s band
howes powerful vocals are by turns 
smoky whispering and roaring she com
mands an incredible range of emotion 
millers guitar is sparse and never overpow
ering often he plays rhythm but when a 
solo rolls along his playing is melodic and 

energetic that dichotomy is helped along 
by auxiliary instruments  a growling ten
or sax a wailing clarinet a rumbling bass 
the music is also textured and complex 
few of the bands songs remain at the same 
tempo throughout a haunting beginning 
will lead into a fastswinging middle then 
descend back into the slow initial tempo 

the transitions are flawless
growing up in montana there can be a 
tendency to disregard our own history as 
distasteful our polite society sometimes 
doesnt like to admit to the prostitutes the 
gamblers and the vigilantes but for howe 
that was a draw i was writing songs about 
bars when i was 17 and had never been 
in one she said she describes her early 

experiences as a sunshiny rural montana 
childhood and this other thing was just 
a draw because i didnt know anything 
about it miller seems to 

find the same interest in 
the darker elements i just 
find vice very very inter
esting he said
the band finds an equal 
inspiration across musical 

genres during the night 
they covered everything 
from ella fitzgerald to 
johnny cash to french 
movie themes to ray 
charles to every song 
they added their own 
unique twists  rhythmic 
variations wailing solos 
and a burnished sound they also showed 

an equal proficiency for songwriting and 
playing others work the majority of the 
songs were originals and covered every
thing from an ode to chicago to a song 
about montanas own potosi hot springs 

they also played jazz standards and howe 
acknowledged southern jazzs influence 
on the band we love trying to spread the 
vibe of new orleans everywhere we go 

she said thats why youre all dancing 
and drinking
it is rare to find something that im
proves on the past imitations rarely 
recapture the original and more often are 
pretentious and selfimportant tumble
down house is neither  their music is 
raw dirty and full of a soul older than 
the musicians themselves sitting in the 
darkened theater it was easy to believe 

you were somewhere else  a speakeasy 
maybe with couples dancing across the 
dim floor and smoke drifting through 
the air listening to the music swirling 
through the theater made it that much 
easier
sexual rights for sexual plights
the jazz 
age 
is immediately 
present in their 
music and all the 
imagery that goes 
with that time  
bootlegged liquor 
murder gangsters 
in three piece suits 
and smoky bars
whether or not you 
are currently on 
birth control or have 
taken emergency 
contraception

   17senior opens some shed exhibit in exit gallery
by 
kaycee
 cronk
some shed actually isnt just any shed  
its the centerpiece of the latest exhibit in the 
exit gallery dripping with black shingles 
and layered with artistic depth the shed was 
constructed by art student abbey freed as 

part of her senior thesis e shed is open for 
interested audiences to 
explore
i think ive always been 
really drawn to the idea 

that artists can choreograph 

spaces or choreograph the 

way people move through 
spaces freed said so thats 
why i wanted to build an 

object that asks the viewer to investigate it
freed is a graduating studio art major 
doublefocusing in painting and sculpture 

ough art has always been a big part of her 
life she initially transferred to msu three 
years ago as a nutrition major but ultimately 

switched into art aer realizing how much 
she missed it having previously shown work 
related to storage in other settings her exhibit 

in the exit gallery is the culmination of  

not only her education  but also her focus 
on objects used for stowing and storage
somehow the idea of a shed  or the word 
shed  popped into my head and i started 
looking at the etymology of that word and i 
became xated on it freed said ough she 

initially doubted her ability to construct an 
object of that scale freed realized she couldnt 
let it go so she went for it and some shed 
was born
e exhibit features a combination of 
installationbased media as well as some 2d 
work for her thesis freed 
really wanted to marry 

painting and drawing and 
incorporate sculpture into 
that as well in addition 

to exploring the ideas of 

loss and melancholia 
she thought of the initial 
concept in may and began 
construction at the start of the semester
e project diers from freeds previous 
work revolving around storage in the sense 

that this exhibit deals with an empty space 
whereas her other work has dealt with storage 
in a very specic way she also stressed that 

within this exhibit there is a heavy emphasis 
on viewer interaction
i hope that viewers walk away with any 
type of experience that they can reect on based 
on the atmosphere i created freed said hope
fully the atmospheric shi that takes place 

between the exterior and the interior of the space 

elicits some sort of experience for them
abbey freed will be hosting a reception in the 
exit 
gallery in su
b 212 on thursday nov 19 from 5  630 
pm her exhibit will be in the 
exit 
gallery until dec 4

revisiting radioheads 
the bends
 at 20
by conor glesner
you can force it but it will not 
come you can taste it but it will not 
form you can crush it but its always 

here om yorke still sounds ex
actly the same on telex planet the 

opening track of radioheads second 
album e bends even aer 20 
years yorkes voice remains un
changed oating above the vibrat
ing distorted guitars on the opening 

track despite its 1995 release the 

album still retains a somewhat uni
versal quality as e atlantics spen
cer kornhaber commented earlier 

this year listening to e bends 
now reminds that this great band is 

great not only because it gives form 
to a certain dark and unspeakable 
truth about modern life but that it 
can when it wants defy it
e bends represents a transi
tional time for the now legendary 
band as they tried to follow up the 
enormous success of their single 
creep released in 1992 eir rst 

album pablo honey saw mediocre 

reviews and lukewarm reception 
and the band found themselves on 
the precipice of becoming a onehit

wonder or being simply labelled as a 
lesser member of nirvanas descen
dants in the recording of e 
bends the band was reportedly 

constantly in conict to the point 
of nearly breaking up but eventually 
1995 saw the release of the album
to those familiar with radio
heads work e bends sounds 
almost too happy too simple too 
normal and it is true  this album 

is closer in spirit to the simple 
grungey goodness of creep than it 
is to the abstract experimental and 
somewhat bizarre construction of 

their later work nevertheless the 

tracks on this album are radiohead 
through and through but instead 
of truly pushing boundaries they 

remain within the realm of guitar 
and drum chorus and bridge e 
songs are comparatively simple but 

driving catchy and an embodiment 

of 90s rock in all the right ways
e most striking thing about 
the album may be the dissonance 

between yorkes lyrics and the oen 

upliing airguitaring nature of the 
songs themselves yorke has never 
exactly written inspirational lyrics to 

put it mildly but they reach a kind 
of peak of blackness in e bends 
yorkes writing took a cryptic sub
textual nature in later work but here 

they are plain and painful as is evi

denced in street spirit fade out 
as he belts out i can feel death see 
its beady eyes over the syncopated 

layers of guitar and drums today it 
seems uncharacteristic for yorke but 
again the album is somewhat of a 

transition for the band
standing from a viewpoint 20 
years in the future and knowing all 

we know now it is easy to see e 

bends as a mere stepping stone for 

radiohead on its path to charttop
ping genrebending position today 

but it is important to recognize the 

context of the album in the mid
90s e bends does sound like a 
cousin of the nirvana grunge wave 

but thats for a reason almost all 
bands become initially successful by 
striking a chord with the popular 

music of their day what separates a 
timeless band from a successful band 
is the ability to overcome and break 
the boundaries of their day and 
bring us along for the ride
is is what is so important about 
e bends in this album you can 

hear that transition listen intently 

past the simple gritty guitar ris and 
distorted synths and you can hear 
everything to come despite the 
monumental changes that radio
head has undergone in the last two 
decades you can still go back to the 
roots and trace them all the way to 
modern day so whats the takeaway 
listen closely the next radiohead 
may be hiding in a top10 hit today 
listen deeper its all there
what separates a timeless band from a successful band is the 
ability to overcome and break the boundaries of their day and 
bring us along for the ride

19whistle pig brings punk to the peopleby conor glesner
in the cold darkness of mon
day night on nov 16 two things 
came pouring out of the doors 
of whistle pig korean light 
and hell of a noise from a block 

away came the gritty guitar and 
fastpaced drums of punk rock 
 a rare sound in bozeman to 
be sure two local punk groups 
joined the headliners cut up 
on tour from san francisco the 

openers were the longtime local 
bands 6p3 and sbd
the threepiece outfit 6p3 
kicked off the night with a set 

of harddriving headbanging 
songs the band has been playing 
out of bozeman for years and 
the experience shows in their 

performance they are totally 
at ease and seem to have nailed 
a sound that works for them 

despite having only one guitar
ist and one bassist the sound is 
full and fleshedout they carry 
this practiced experience with a 

lighthearted attitude even play
ing one song about how they had 

rocked hard in the past but have 

since gotten too old
the headliners cut up took 
the second slot the bay area 

based group is on tour and 

decided to make the trip to boze
man due to some connections 

with whistle pigs coowner 

ross franklin cut up is a four
piece band consisting of lead and 
rhythm guitar bass and drums 

all of which contribute to the 

rough yet melodic sound that 
the group produces on a massive 
scale its the kind of music that 

makes it impossible to sit still 
something about it just makes 
you want to move as if the solid 

wall of sound is literally moving 

you back and forth
local group sbd finished up 
the night sbd stands out as 

a punk band due to the inclu
sion of an electronic keyboard 

alongside the traditional bass 

guitar and drums while 

distorted guitar riffs wailed 
and deep baselines kicked the 
electronic keyboard was ever

present  sometimes mirroring 
or complimenting riffs other 
times producing a melody all its 
own its an interesting combina
tion of grit and quirk  much 

like the band itself almost every 
band member wore a shirt with 
some kind of fantasy character 

on it no less than two unicorns 
and one dragon and one of their 

songs was happily introduced as 
laser cats unique to say the 
least
overall this proved to be a 
rather unusual concert for boze
man this is in large part thanks 
to whistle pigs coowner frank
lin who founded the business 
with his wife the two met while 
they were both teaching english 
in south korea 
when we decided to open the 
business i wanted to do some
thing with music and my wife 
wanted to do something with 
food franklin said thus whis
tle pig was born not just food 
but a forum for local music at 
first the focus of the restaurant 
was on food but franklin says 
that after about a year they 
began to host regular live shows 
at first they were intermittent 
but franklin designed a huge 
undertaking for this past summer 
 a live show with two bands 
every night for the entire sum
mer the series of shows culmi

nated in a compilation album of 
15 different singles from as many 
local bands all produced and 
distributed under franklins own 
whistle pig records the album 

can be currently found at cactus 
records
franklin said that shows will 
be less often during the winter 

and spring but by no means will 
they stop the next bands to play 
will be modern sons panther 
car and chairea on dec 13 be 
sure to stop by  entry to all 
shows is free and you cant go 
wrong supporting such a great 
forum for local music

asmsu in favor of new degree programs for msu gallatin college
by julie donagan
asmsu senate voted 17 to 1 
in favor of a resolution to sup
port the addition of a hospitality 
program to the jake jabs college 

of business and entrepreneur
ship on thursday nov 19 the 

proposed program would add a 

bachelors degree in hospitality 

management through msu and 

an associates degree in culinary 

arts through gallatin college 

the senates resolution voiced 

student support for the degree 

program a movement which 

previously failed twice in faculty 

senate with a vote of 14 to 17 

despite the unfavorable outcome 

among faculty senate advocates 

for the program include president 

waded cruzado who opened 

the asmsu senate meeting by 

expressing her support provost 

martha potvin and dean kregg 

aytes from the college of busi

ness
the asmsu senate meeting 
was attended by 13 individuals 

who spoke during public com
ment 12 in favor of the addition 

and one opposed arguments for 

the program were that it would be 

a large asset to montanas growing 

tourism industry allowing em
ployers to hire msu alumni rath
er than recruiting employees and 

interns from out of state none 

of the universities in montana 

currently have a 4year hospitality 

degree option requiring students 

interested in the field to leave the 

state and for employers to recruit 

primarily outside of montana 

according to potvin there are 

currently culinary programs at 

the university of montana um

and flathead valley community 

college as well as a forestry and 

recreation management degree 

option at um
e initiative has already been 
backed by major tourism strong
holds in montana including big 

sky and the yellowstone club 

additionally business owners in 
bozeman have voiced support 
roth jordan and sean faris 
managing partner and gen
eral manager respectively 
of montana ale works 
and mike hope owner 
of the rocking r bar 
all spoke during public 
comment claim
ing that graduates 
from a hospitality 
degree program would be highly 

employable in their industry bob 

hietala dean of gallatin college 

stressed that as the demand for 

the hospitality degree is there 

msu should respond with this 

program when we listen to 

industry it works he said
for a new degree program to be 
oered cruzado must submit a 

proposal to the board of regents 

is is usually done with faculty 

support although it is not a re
quirement e board of regents 

can then approve or deny the 

proposal according to potvin 

if the proposal is made and goes 

through the degree would be of

fered for the rst time during fall 

2017 or 2018
according to asmsu presi
dent levi birky senate opinion 

was originally split as it was in fac

ulty senate however aer hearing 

so many arguments about how a 

hospitality program would benet 

msu students and montana as a 

whole attitudes of asmsu sena
tors changed and the body voted 

to express its support
e diverse array of individu
als who oered public comment 

showed that this is an important 

topic for msu and the montana 

community alike in a written 

statement aytes said i 
have seldom seen such broad com
munity support for a new degree 

cruzado advocated the impor
tance to students as well as to the 
community is is our responsi

bility as the peoples university to 

open doors of opportunity not to

head football coach red aer rst losing season
by david atkinson
msu red head coach rob 
ash of the cats football team 
on monday nov 23 athletic 

director peter fields made the 

announcement last week follow
ing a defeat at the paws of msus 

rivals the university of montana 

grizzlies fields said that he made 

his decision to re ash due to 

the fact that the team didnt meet 

performance expectations during 

this season fields said were not 

going to win the championship 

every year but we should be in the 

mix every year with the resources 

that we put into it we should
ashs record over his seasons at 
montana state was 7038 and he 

helped the team to at least a share 

of league titles from 20102012 

and again in 2014 however his 

lateseason performance has been 

subpar as of late winning only 

four out of 13 games in the final 

month of the last three seasons 
fields voiced that firing ash 
was a difficult decision he laud
ed ashs personality saying that 

ash is a good person and hes a 

competitor and hes invested in 

what he does and believes in what 

he does
despite a great record overall 
ashs bobcats had a record of 

414 against rivals university of 

montana and eastern washing
ton which played a large role in 

fields evaluation of the program 

the cats 56 record this past 

season and a stagnancy in late 

season play played in recent years 

also were a part of the decision to 

fire ash
ash came to msu in 2007 
following drug scandals involving 

football players and poor academ
ic performance in the mid 2000s 

he was tasked with increasing 

athletes academic performance 

as well as bettering the programs

carnegie classication
 oers prestige to msu
by seth urick
msu is one of 108 universities in the us 
to hold the classication as a research uni
versity with very high research activity ru
vh according to the carnegie classica
tion of institutions of higher education 

since their inception carnegie classica
tions have been and continue to be widely 

accepted as the standard categorization of 

accredited us colleges and universities 
in terms of what msu gets 
out of the classication the 

answer is largely prestige being 

identied in the ruvh group 

says we are a serious player in 

the nation in terms of research 

said tracy ellig director of 

university communications 
because of this many schools 
strive to obtain or maintain 
high rankings in the system 
msu received the ruvh 

classication from the founda
tion in 2005 at a time when 

there were only 94 universities 

that held the classication
carnegie classications were 
created in 1973 by the carnegie foundation 

for the advancement of teaching cfat 

cfat was founded for the advancement of 

education by billionaire steel magnate and 

philanthropist andrew carnegie in 1905 

and chartered in 1906 by congress e 

carnegie classication of institutions of 
higher education was conceived as a frame
work for labeling dierent types of colleges 

and universities
since then the framework has been up
dated four times in order to address changes 
in schools across the nation on oct 14 

2014 the foundation transferred responsibil
ity for the carnegie classications to the in
diana university center for postsecondary 

research the change was made eective jan 

1 2015msus placement in the ruvh class was 
determined by looking at four research activ
ity correlates 1 research and development

while carnegie classications can be 
useful they are intended to be used as a tool 

to compare similar institutions instead of 
diverse ones
its important to note that 
the carnegie classication of 

institutions of higher educa
tion is not a rating system it is 

an eort to identify institutions 

with similar characteristics so 

that comparisons can be made 
between apples and apples 
not apples and oranges ellig 
explained
whatever prestige may be 
associated with them carnegie 
classications do not confer 

explicit advantages nancial or 

otherwise on the universities or 

colleges that receive them it 
only confers the advantages that come with 

any prestigious title or classication ellig 

said
e classication may help us recruit 
faculty and graduate students interested in 

being in research extensive environments

institutions  but by no means would the 
classication ever be the sole criteria by 
which someone would make a decision to 
come to msu ellig said other things such 
as pay for faculty scholarships for grad 

students spousal accommodations lifestyle 

t the depth of research in a particular area 

and many other factors come into play when 

recruiting faculty and graduate students 

he continued e classication is certainly 

helpful but it does not exist in a vacuum  

while the designation does matter to some 

undergraduates they still primarily choose 

colleges based on price degree availability 

location and family aliation

onmsu administration fails to represent msu in firing rob ash
on monday nov 23 msu athletic 
director peter fields held a noon press 
conference to announce the termination 

of head football coach rob ash e an
nouncement came just a day aer 

the cats lost the the university of 

montana grizzlies at home 5435 

ash wrapping up his ninth year 

as head coach boasted a 7038 

record as head coach  the win
ningest coach in bobcat history 

 but was 56 this season and 

only 36 against conference oppo
nents ash guided the cats to four 

playo berths during his tenure including 

three big sky conference championships 

and made it to the fcs quarternals twice 

shepherding the msu program from under 

the shadows of former coach mike kramer 

and ushering in a cleaner era of bobcat foot
ball ash was a representative of the com
munity school and state that everyone could 

be proud of and the administration make a 

huge mistake letting him go 
unlike the nfl college football should 
be about more than just wins and losses 

scholarship integrity and character matter 
far more than passing yards and points al
lowed but in kicking ash out the door the 

university has apparently decided that statis

tics are most important now we can only 
speculate as to any behindclosed

doors friction but on the surface 

the only tension between ash and 

the administration appeared to be 

footballrelated if this is indeed 

the case msu should be ashamed 

of the decision ash brought this 

program to respectability and built 

it into a contender but not one 

focused on winning at any cost
roughout the press conference fields 
discussed an ongoing evaluation process 

for msu coaches creating a whathave

youdoneformelately atmosphere fields 

also stressed that the evaluation was based 

on oneld performance and that msu 

football was doing very well in terms of 

academics and community service he 

goes on to state that he believes the msu 

should be an annual top 10 program in the 

nation eres nothing wrong with having 

aspirations but theres more to being a top 

program and sustaining success than always 
looking for an upgrade college football is a 

notoriously volatile enterprise e best pro
grams dont stay that way forever looking 

at giants like nebraska miami ohio state 

or texas  not one program can claim that 

they have always been a top 10 program 

e same goes for university of montana 

georgia southern or montana state 
but things such as avoiding negative 
press having perennial academic all

americans building a respectable program 

and not having jon krakauer books written 

about your university are hallmarks of a 

great program here at msu it would be 

prudent to remember that we are not ala
bama or lsu we cannot be an fcs cham
pion every single year without compro
mising our values academic or otherwise 

a reckless pursuit of wins regardless of 

consequence is what got msu in trouble 

in the mid2000s something that fields 

should remember  considering it almost 

cost him his job as well these are the kind 

of times that we will see again if the admin
istration continues its trajectory 
but above all else the administration 
should be ashamed of how they treated 
ash on both a personal and professional 

level ash always composed and calm  

even after his termination  represented 

montana state with class class that 

given recent events the administration 

doesnt deserve over the last challenging 

year bandwagon fans crawled out of the 

woodwork and wanted ashs head and 

fields and msu president waded cruzado 

capitulated to the demands of fairweather 

fans if thats how we act as a fanbase then 

we show that we dont deserve him either 

and its more than likely that we wont 

get a better coach on or off the field if 

this is how we treat our winningest coach 

how will we treat other coaches how can 

we attract the best of the best in a toxic 

atmosphere
but whats done is done and we will 
move on from here everyone in bobcat 

nation should thank coach ash for all he 

has done for us he deserves our respect 

and our commendation he represented all 

of us well and his mark on bobcat football 

will not be forgotten anytime soon thank 

you coach ash and good luck on what
ever your next step is

  7food for ought entitlement is free pizza with a side of learning
catapalooza is a chaotic whirlwind of 
discovering new options being suckered 
into pointless clubs and  most importantly 

 receiving free things it starts college 

students on the path of incentivized extracur
riculars for the rest of their years at 

msu catapalooza teaches fresh
men an important lesson never go 

to any meeting club or lecture that 

is not required for a class unless 

there is an external motivator aka 

free pizza and beer
it seems that all worthwhile 
functions these days provide 

sustenance primarily because the 

attendees attribute value to food 

is cultural view has placed undue impor
tance on getting a physical reward for partici

pating so much so that clubs choose to spend 

their relatively small amounts of money on 

food for an hour long meeting rather than 

activities related to the purpose of the group 

itself e commitment of nancial resources 

implies that the presence of food or some 

other free item is critical to the survival of 

the club because leaders typically respond to 

the demands of the people around them this 

speaks more to the members than the leaders 

of the various organizations people want an 

incentive to be involved in anything outside 
their daily routine well theres free food 

can easily be used as the crux of an argument 

in favor of attending an event toss in free 

beer and people will show up guaranteed 
food is a valuable commodity at any age 
and especially for poor college 

students not having to pay for 

pizza is a gi from the otherwise 

harsh college deities at does not 

mean that any educational value 

from the evening should be heard 

only in between bouts of chewing 

and beer gurgling it is not only 

possible but important to choose 

to attend a lecture because the 

speaker has interesting content and 
not just because there are dayold cookies and 

watereddown punch in the back 
lack of an incentive can hold students back 
from incredible experiences imagine a profes

sor tells his class about a lecture on cuban 

politics that would count for extra credit a 

typical student would dislike the idea of giving 

up ursday evening but it is a gradebooster 

e student attends and it turns out to be a 

wildly interesting topic at the end the speak
er looks around at the pitiful few members of 

the audience ten at most and thanks them for 

attending e student would have missed out 

on an informative and eyeopening experience 
without those 10 extra credit points that tore 

them away from netix 
college students should be beyond the 
point of needing someone to encourage 

extracurricular activity ere are posters all 

over campus that advertise free food yes but 

also educational opportunities life chang
ing speakers and cultural experiences last 

year despite the glaring lack of food the 

stands were packed for the christianity and 
the tooth fairy discussion about god and 

atheism is event is just one of many that 

are evidence to the college students capacity 

to look beyond the stomach when decid
ing what to do with precious free timetry 

actively scanning the boards that are plastered 

with event posters and dicult though it 

may be do not use food as a criteria for value 

no matter what dominos says education is 

worth more than pizza

i        grew up in sacramento the 25 million

person capital city of california e city is a 
bastion of progressive policy experiences only a 
threemonth pseudo winter with av
erage highs in the 50s and has been 
named by time as the most diverse 

city in the united states in short its 
about as far as you can get politically 
climatologically and culturally from 
montana while still being in the 

same country
originally montana state was not 
on my radar in fact like many of us 
on the west coast i didnt really 
know where montana was or if it was populat
ed i was under the impression that it was one of 

those states we drew out and then forgot about 
 only home to a population of moose and 
ted kaczynskis cabin but an aggressive mailing 

campaign by msu drew my attention and the 
photos of mountains and cat statues persuaded 
me to apply a scholarship oer and a stunning 
rst visit to the big sky however won my heart
montana challenged me in every pos
sible way my fourish years here have been a 
condensed comingofage age story it seems 
everything of import happened here while i 
arrived at 18 i hardly felt like an adult but leav
ing home and its comfort  being 

a thousand miles and many hours 

away from any family or safety net  

quickly develops endogenous inde
pendence i could have never learned 

in california regardless of how far 

from sacramento i went it was 
while in montana that the grueling 
psychological demolition of school 

work and selfexploration allowed 

me to recognize my sexuality and 
begin redening my identity i cant imagine too 

many californians have abandoned the cultural 

safety and legal protections of the west coast 

to come out as a minority in the red and misun
derstanding state of montana it was the most 

dicult struggle i had endured complicated 

by the denial encouraged by widelypropagated 
cultural pressures at is until i was challenged 
by a dramatic degradation of my mental health 

which wrecked the sense of independence and 

stability i had spent years building and threw 
me into the arms of a healthcare system that was 
largely inaccessible
montana is home to the most painful memo
ries of my life but they changed me immensely 
for the better e isolation forced rapid matu
ration and catalyzed true psychological growth 

it strengthened me to an extent that would not 

have been possible anywhere else but while ill 

never forget the negative experiences the posi

tive ones will always be far more numerous and 
vivid in my memory e friends i serendipi
tously met in my rst week are still my closest 

with my family so far away my friends helped 

ll their absence eir role in my collegiate suc

cess was as imperative as the classes i took and 

for their presence in my life im grateful
when you get close to graduating you be
come progressively and inexplicably nostalgic 

even more so when youre moving far away its 

a daily struggle to not cry in public an issue 

surely augmented by sleep deprivation and my 
gastrointestinally destructive diet of candy and 
protein bars but it provides a fantastic opportu
nity for retrospection and appreciation
with just days to go until i waltz across the 
stage im coming to hug you cruzado i feel 
overwhelmingly thankful for my time here 
one of the things im most thankful for is the 

msu exponent the organization that taught 
me that impassioned involvement was far more 

important than engaged leadership its the 
one activity i did every semester of college e 
relationships i built over crippling laughter at 
3 am on production night are some of my 

most cherished and the skills the job taught me 
are more applicable to a career than anything i 
learned in the classroom
it goes without saying that im forever 
indebted both guratively and literally to 
my parents i am tremendously appreciative of 
their unrelenting support and tireless eorts to 
improve my life  even if it is with the expecta
tion that ill be funding their retirement ey 
have my eternal gratitude
while im indescribably excited to return 
to sacramento  the city that will forever be 
home  this state city its university and its 

people will always be held close at heart so long 
and thanks for all the everything

5 easy steps to getting through finals
finals are coming up and unfor
tunately most of us arent going 
to make it 
  im speaking to the nine out of 10 

students who are more than likely 

going insane andor going to fail 

ere are a few easy steps you can 

take to get through the week with
out actually dying though
step 1 get over yourself when 
you think about it people really 

dont care about you once you understand 

that you dont matter then by logic things in 
your life like nals dont really matter either 

so why worry however more oen than not 
its harder to come to terms with 

this than it is to actually study for 

nals so most people will have to 

continue with step 2
step 2 go to the library e 
library is full of many great re
sources like coee and places to sit 

down both of these things will be 

essential in getting through nals 

sitting in a chair or on something 

else  perhaps a bench or a sculp
ture  will help you to rest in the tiresome 

week to come coee will help you do this 
without ever sleeping so you can still be 

productive see step 3 also there is a little 

known community bath on the third oor 

right next to fun circle chairs 
step 3 no sleep you may recall in a previ
ous edition when we discussed the medical 

benets of sleep deprivation and theres no 

better time to try that out than when you 

have to be 100 percent focused 110 percent 

of the time
step 4 dont drink and drive e roads 
are icy and dangerous this time of year the 

last thing you need on top of drowsiness be
hind the wheel is a 008 or higher save that 

booze for kickers and core classes
step 5 turn to philosophy in times of 
trouble i really like hearing the wisdom of 

others when im feeling down and out stoics 

have some great writing on what to do when 

the going gets tough a random philosopher 

once wrote lastly a party is broken up 

because supplies have run out and so suicide 

is permissible in case of poverty when there 

is no chance of support from the side of the 

good for we should not accept it from the 

wicked since the gis of the unclean are 

themselves unclean and we must not soil our 

hands with them in other words if youre 

not ready for your nal dont cheat just give 

up simple as that

why are we here at is probably the 

question were all asking ourselves as we 
approach the most stressful time of the year 

dead week and nals week we can all probably 

agree that earning a degree is what 

motivated us to come to college but 

i think we can also agree that the 

social aspect is what keeps us here 

personally the extracurriculars ive 

participated in have motivated me 

more than classes ever have and i 

do not think i am alone in that 
as we release the last edition of 
the semester i nd myself reecting 

on our fruitful and productive semester pleased 

with the hard work of the exponent sta in 

my two and a half years with the exponent i 

have come across some of the most creative 

hardworking and motivated people ive ever 

met every week students from all majors con
tribute to the production of our paper every 

week throughout canceled stories late nights 

and printing troubles we somehow surprise 

ourselves when we produce yet another edition 
we wouldnt be where we are without the ded
ication and hard work of the 60 student workers 

and their terric contributions to the exponent

support and assistance throughout the year 
with the upcoming commencement 
ceremony we are losing two longtime writers 

and incredible exponent contributors matt 

williams and will hamel 
matt williams ank you for being a 
constant contributor to the exponent the 

past four and a half years youve provided 

the exponent with fantastic news coverage 

with a specialty in crime writing and youve 

even written a few fun culture articles which 

typically involved reviewing wine and alcohol 
ank you for your sarcastic sense of humor 

that always lightens the mood even when you 

so mercilessly aim that sarcasm at me 
will hamel ank you for providing expo
nent readers with a weekly chuckle in the form of 

your column wills world every week you pro
vided us with a humorous strange and an overall 

terric read well miss your funny yet awkward 

jokes and interesting perspective on life  
well miss you both more than words can 
express dont forget about us as you embark 

on your undoubtedly successful postgradua
tion journey and good luck with everything 

that you do
lastly to the production night crew thank 
you for being the best people to work with at 
4 am you guys are pure gold  
editors note as youve probably noticed 
this exponent edition is a little dierent than 

our normal editions we call this our hast
ily illustrated edition where instead of using 

photographs everything is handdrawn 

e hastily illustrated edition has been an 

exponent tradition and it falls on dead week 

for a reason it gives us a chance to lighten the 

somber mood surrounding dead and nals 

week aer all were students too and we un
derstand how stressful dead and nals week can 

be so hopefully this gives you at least a slight 

chuckle  even if youre just laughing at our lack 

of artistic ability

dance or else signing o aer over a year of wills world
i know what youre thinking no not 
another cheesy selfindulgent farewell arti
cle uick where is the sudoku where are 

the police reports and where is the holy 

grail ill answer these for you in order 

back page page insert page here and tom 

bradys house all of these are ne areas to 

investigate but hear me out this is my last 

article for the exponent hold your cheers 

for later and if i have any parting advice to 

give its a slight variation of yolo though 

without the hipster music
my freshman year in college the langford 
rha which i was a part of organized a 

christmas dance fresh o my breakup i 

invited a friend of mine from class to attend 

the dance with me i was attracted to her but 

shy and afraid i would mess it up i thought 

to myself will no one wants to spend 

three hours with you cut it in half so even 

though i was free to dance all i wanted i gave 

her the lame excuse of ill join you in a little 

bit i have to watch over the refreshments
wow that was a tough paragraph to 
write even years later i can feel how 

lame that decision was just by typing it 

out you can guess what happened next 

i stood there with my thumb in my butt 

waiting for the right moment when sud
denly a suave student showed up and 

swept her off her feet i felt like chandler 

in friends though without the re
deeming qualities since this mishap was 

entirely my fault
she and i have spoken about this and 
weve become good friends years later ive 

come to realize we had little in common 

and would not have been a longlasting 

couple however that realization came 

after a year and a half of asking whatif 

rather than just going for it and dancing
this brings me to my graduate years i 
always felt that i didnt experience what 

i should have during my undergraduate 

years its true that the course load played 

a role but if im being brutally honest i 
oftentimes used this as an excuse rather 

than trying something new or meaningful
which brought me to the exponent i 
missed writing and felt i could contribute 

with sportsthemed articles mixed with 

the obscure and irrelevant hence the mel 

brooks references i was lucky that nicole 

duggan and megan bernhardt and later 

cassia wagner erin murdock and davis 

connelley welcomed me and my strange
ness to the exponent
my writing usually followed the following 
pattern obscure area of sports press con
ferences recruiting timetravel plus theme 

of random references blazing saddles 

gilmore girls andor henry kissinger re
ally i still cant believe they let me write
as a result of writing at the exponent 
and other interests ive used my graduate 

years to pursue i can truly say i enjoyed 

these last years as tacky as it sounds it 

really does matter how you mix your work 

with your play
writing and sports broadcasting work 
may not be what gets you going and thats 

not the moral here rather i hope you 

dont end your undergraduate years as i did 

instead and it kills me to say it because it 

sounds too much like a song from fun do 

what you enjoy  unless its really stupid
will said to do what i enjoy uick 
light these reworks in my butt
will said to do what i enjoy uick 
attach these cinderblocks to my feet im 

going swimming
yada yada yada uick get the car im 
voting for the bull moose party
its important to take this time to study 
and improve yourself academically and 

professionally its also important to take a 

chance try something you love and then 

overdo it to death we only have so much 

time otherwise we risk becoming an adele 

song
to summarize ill end my writing here 
with the following advice dance or else
season to be remembered as the end of rob ash
by andrew waters
this season wasnt what the 
bobcat football team expected 

it to be preseason coaches poll 

had msu at number one in the 

big sky conference which made 

for some mighty expectations 

with the return of junior dakota 

prukop at quarterback leading 

the offense after a sophomore 

season in which he threw for 

2559 yards and passed for 18 

touchdowns it seemed like a safe 

bet
 e season started o against 
the fort lewis skyhawks from du
rango colorado  the cats lone 

division ii opponent e 4514 

steamrolling was a fantastic way to 

kicko the season with the defen
sive highlight of the year coming 

from a gigantic hit by sophomore 

mac bignell next up was the high 

ying oense of eastern washing
ton is was the rst time fans 

got a glimpse of what would be 

the biggest issue for the bobcats 

all season  an inability to make 

stops on defense  however the 

bobcat oense almost carried 

them to victory with an outstand
ing game from prukop accounting 

for 549 yards by himself
the cats would remain at 
500 until november with wins 

against cal poly sacramento 

state and east tennessee their 
losses came at the hands of 

northern arizona portland 

state and north dakota each 

loss had the same formula op
position gets a first half lead 

and then the offense had to play 

catchup and close the gap until 

the defense would give up a big 

touchdown
the week eight loss to north 
dakota mathematically elimi

nated the bobcats from playoff 

consideration the cats had 

to bounce back quick with 

eventually conference cham
pion southern utah at home up 

next the bobcats had not lost 
at home since september 2014 

and were looking to extend the 

streak after a strong first half

hyalite hijinx and the benets of poor conditionse subtle art of fatty fitness and yes you should eat that donut
by theodore grover
its no secret that the skiings not great right 
now aer a solid start to november the slopes 
around southwest montana have started to dry 

up and the tide is low e month of december 

consequently begins with a shallow and weak 

snowpack strained by a lack of fresh snowfall and 

strong temperature gradients ese unfortunate 
developments will likely prove problematic later 
in the season however on a recent romp around 

hyalite i was reminded that it doesnt always take 

a great snowpack to enjoy a day of skiing
my roommates and i le our house for hyalite 
at the crack of noon well technically not even 

that early as it was closer to 1 pm by the time we 

got moving we had no plan and no expecta
tions which was fortunate because it took forever 
to get ourselves up to the reservoir we were 
hindered by an empty gas tank and consequently 

a return trip to town and numerous drivers who 
drove as if they had never seen snow on a road be
fore however at long last our dusk patrol began
it was too late in the day to ski anything mean
ingful e western slopes encompassing hyalite 
were already bronzing with the setting sun we 
set out in the general direction of a meadow 

above the reservoir with intentions of skiing if 
conditions allowed we skinned for a couple 
miles only to nd that no it wasnt skiable the 

tide was low and the waters were sharky large 

logs and boulders lurked beneath the shimmer
ing snow just waiting to grab the unsuspecting 
skier and rip a fat piece of core out of their skis 
however this illfated discovery turned out to 
be the best part of the tour rather than hanging 
our heads in defeat a new plan soon took shape 

we would race a chinese downhill back to the 

car but with a twist my fellow skiers and i would 
ski down without our at bindings clamped 
down meaning there would be nothing attach
ing our heels to our skis and the sole snowboard
er in the group would in turn ski down literally 

as he would not reattach the two halves of his 

splitboard it was a race for the ages 
extensive jockeying ensued at the start as we 
grappled for the lead i pushed my friend o the 
trail to jump in front of him but was soon over
taken myself on the rst big corner i dropped 
my knee in an attempt to make a tele turn but 
fell forward and crashed into the brush my 
friends raced by me once again jockeying for the 

lead upon regaining my composure i took o 

aer them only to nd the splitboarder turned 

tele skier sprawled out in the middle of the trail 

around the next bend i hopped over him and 

continued down the windy trails that lead to 
hyalite reservoir 
alas i could not retake the lead i arrived at 
the car behind the others content to not have 

nished dead last we waited for the slowboarder 

to make his way back to the parking lot and then 

headed home e trivial race brought a smile 

to all our faces and turned a dull tour into an 

adrenaline packed freeforall it was also a subtle 

reminder that it doesnt always take epic condi

tions to have a good time skiing even when the 
snowpack is less than ideal and it hasnt snowed 
for a week theres always fun to be had when 

youre sliding down snow
by parker webb
in a complete and utterly over
expressive generalization i am 
going to state that people tend 

to exercise to lose weight and 

be healthy ey do aerobic and 

strength workouts to stay lean 

and more oen than not this also 

entails a healthy diet full of ingredi

ents that are organic locally grown 

and low in fat among other healthy 

things ey shop at the coop 

but what if i told you that it didnt 

have to be this way at you didnt 

have to count the calories you eat 

at its okay to eat that burrito 

and the tacos what if i told you 

that there was a group out there 

that did rad outdoor activities not 

to be healthy but rather so that 

they can eat whatever the hell they 

want welcome my friend to the 

wonderful world of fatty fitness 

fatty fitness is according to their 

facebook page a group of mildly 

athletic mountain folk who use our 

high output activities as a means 

of eating in a way that would cause 

a sedentary human to balloon to 

800 pounds is lifestyle gives the 
paleo vegan and gluten free diet 

the middle nger  because life is 

too short to give a rats bottom over 

what you eat
 e fatty fitness code of living 
is the best of both worlds long 

days in the mountains are followed 

by equally long times spent at the 

chinese buet you get to shred 

to your hearts desire and visit that 

donut shop that stays open late 

training is part of the eating pro
cess not the other way around do 

not eat to train and shred hard in 

the mountainous regions instead 

climb the mountain so you can 

push your spoon or ladle into a 

mountain of mashed potatoes run 

the ridge because at the end the 

beer and cheeseburgers are going 

to be ohmygod so good eres a 

war on deliciousness and only you 

can change this
fatty fitness is scientically 
proven to be 100 percent eec

tive at warding o bad times since 

climbing and skiing are awesome 

and donuts are equally just as awe
some e beauty of fatty fitness 

is it transcends just doing outdoor 

activities hard and eating hard its 
a means to escape the sorrows of 

the world ere are troubles all 

over the world but hold on my 

pie just got out of the oven and i 

need my entire attention to get the 

right amount of pie all of it into 

my belly perhaps you are doubting 

the fatty fitness regime and you 

believe that perhaps real athletes 

do not partake in such a glorious 

and wonderful ideology athlete 

and writer brendan leonard has 

written many articles on the glory 

of free solo eating extreme picnick
ing and how to incorporate a run 

into a 4k day 4000 calorie day 

that is kilian jornet the most 

extreme ultrarunner of the steep 

mountains ate roughly 4 jars of 

nutella while on denali training 

for the speed record matthew 

inman writer for e oatmeal 

even has a video made by the run
ning company saucony about his 

cake eating and running habits 

pros and lifestyle enthusiasts all 

around are in full blown praise of 

the fatty fitness routine
so yes do eat that donut and 
the one next to it you have nothing 

to lose because fatty fitness

   15e flush hunting california anksgiving pheasant
by nick kasser
they call it a cackle its more 
like a cluck to me but i suppose 
it doesnt really matter the 

sound a pheasant makes when 
its scared out of high grass by a 
pointing bird dog is something 

special
i step out of the car and look 
at the fields all around me there 

are hunters dressed out in blaze 

orange cradling shotguns and 

calling to their dogs to come 

here and find the birds 
there are acres upon acres of 
fields full of everything from 

wheat to corn to burs to grass 
to dirt and water and the oc
casional bush or tree i crack my 

gun open and put in two shells 

of steel sixshot some people 
care about brand but ive always 
thought that my aim is more im
portant than whatever name is 

on my box of shotgun shells my 
boots are laced up and already 
caked with mud pheasant grass 

seems to be perpetually wet 

even on the hottest days the 

fields are full of stalks of brown 
wheat grass that reach up to your 
knees and  hopefully  birds
the dog works the fields in 
front of me tearing along from 
side to side in a zigzag motion 
the sun has been up for a few 

hours now and the birds are 

starting to warm up and get ac

tive my hunting partners walk 
in a line beside me making last 
minute checks on loads and 

pockets adjusting where theyll 
keep their shells so they dont 
have to look for them when they 

need to reload its hot already 

under the california sun and 

the mosquitos are out in force 
my pants are soaked up to my 
knees and we can hear other 

hunters banging away with their 

guns at flushing pheasants 
and although it is not quiet it 
is peaceful one or two shots 

means a bird in the bag four 

or five shots and some cursing 
means that their quarry lives to 
fly another day  
all of a sudden our dogs de
meanor changes he slows down 
and puts his nose low to the 
ground instead of zigzagging he 

moves in a drunk mans straight 

line going in one purposeful 

direction but wobbling a little 
to each side on the way he 
stops and my heart speeds up 
i breathe and do what i always 
do to settle my nerves turn my 
safety on then off again if i fo
cus on my safety im not think
ing about missing and if im not 
thinking about missing i usually 
dont the problem comes when 
i am focused on anything other 

than simply hitting the bird
i am up ahead of my partners 
now getting closer and closer to 
the dog who is standing stock 
still with his head forward tail 
back and one paw up he is star
ing with singleminded intensity 

at the bird in front of me i cant 
see it yet but the dog has a far 
better nose than i do so i trust 
him i tell him go and the 
bird blows out of the grass six 
feet in front of my face it cack
les like mad warning other birds 

of danger i swing my gun up 

and the right barrel of my dads 
old sidebyside speaks the 
pheasant folds and falls out of 
the sky to the ground below the 
dog brings back my bird with a 
mouthful of feathers and then 
trots off to continue his work
we end the morning with nine 
pheasant after doing four walk
throughs of our field and flush
ing 12 chukar that we decide not 
to shoot we missed one bird 

that came tearing across the field 

past all four of us when all four 
of you miss the same bird there 
is nothing to do but swear re
load shake your head and laugh 
other than that we all shoot 
well and go home satisfied the 
birds will go on a dinner table 
and that will make for a happy 
thanksgiving

paint the growler
 showcases art incredible stories
by keegan grady
bozeman is a town that knows its way around 
a beer eight breweries and a lot of bars provide 
places for the eager drinker to wet their lips and 

the town is somewhat notorious for kicking 

back on friday nights but as prevalent as beer 

and alcohol are they rarely get a chance to show 

their artistic potential enter revolvr menswear 

and pintpass together with the challenged 

athletes foundation they recently held a 

unique event  an art show made entirely of 

beer bottles
e show held friday nov 20 was dubbed 
paint the growler each of the bottles was up 

for auction and the bids were owing in fast 

proceeds went both to the challenged athletes 

foundation and the upcoming documentary 

charged e foundation helps traumatized 

patients recover from accidents regain abilities 
and discover new potential in their words their 

mission is to provide opportunities and support 

to people with physical challenges so they can 

pursue active lifestyles through physical tness 

and competitive athletics one local member of 

caf is named eduardo garcia and paint the 

growler was only part of his incredible story
garcia is the subject of charged a 
documentary chronicling his story in 2011 

garcia was a successful chef  as he described 

it very condent about where i was in life 

en on a trip into montanas backcountry he 

came across a dead bear curious he touched 

it with his knife and up through the knifes 

blade came 2400 volts of electricity ere 

was no way to know that bear was on a live 

power source he said a freak accident and 

garcias life was forever changed his long

time partner jen had gone back to england a 

few months prior she immediately ew back 
to salt lake and spent 49 days in intensive 

care with garcia muscles had to be cut away 

and to save his life doctors amputated his le 

hand en while undergoing surgeries to 

recover from his injuries he was told he had 

stage 2 testicular cancer he was own back 

to montana to undergo chemotherapy but 

through it all he was sustained by a burning 

desire to live e second my eyes opened on 

that forest oor and i had a heartbeat  im 

gonna get myself back to that  back to life
e growlers in revolvr were for his benet 
and the community had turned out spectacu
lar work local artists and companies had 

come together to create truly unique pieces of 

salvage art e growlers round shape forced 

viewers to look at the entirety of the work to 

see everything they had to take the time to 

walk around the entire shape examine every 

side and see the whole thing before judging it 
it led to a unique artistic experience  a work 

that immersed the viewer completely if only 

for the time it took to circle it 
bozeman resident callum gannon was 
most impressed by the artists visions its 

good to see art in a dierent medium he said 

its incredible to see what these artists can cre
ate from something thats already made
legendary painter edgar degas once said 
art is not about what you see its about what 

you make others see at idea captures the 

essence of paint the growler as guests 

weaved through the crowded store they were 

struck not by the impressiveness of the works 

though they were incredible but by the 

people who were there every one of them was 

there for a cause in the forefront of everyones 

minds was the story of eduardo garcia  a 

story of resilience determination and triumph 

and that was truly something worth seeing

you should probably avoid this dull 

foray into the punk music scene on 

the one hand the lm has a killer 

soundtrack but on the other its 

poorly written strangely cast and 

doesnt do its source material the 

true story of the rise of some of the 

best punk acts in existence justice

e ya novels this lm is based on 

are a wild ride but theyre aimed 
at a very specic audience ie 

teenage girls and the lm adapta

marginalized ie teenage girls 

who read the books however 

having once been a teenage girl 

who read the books i think 
i have the authority to say this 

movie was  disappointing but if

 17most of us have experience with the 
vast set of rules the transportation 
security administration tsa has 

put in place for travel including shoe 

removal and examination of pretty 
much any item containing metal how
ever many travelers may be unaware 
of the rules concerning vibrators and 

other pleasure devices
while some toys can certainly be 
placed into your carry on other toys 
are best le in your checked baggage 
vibrators dildos and other toys that are 

shorter than seven inches are accept
able for your carryon in 

order to avoid any poten
tially embarrassing situa
tions in the security line 

remove your batteries 
from a batteryoperated 
vibrator many recharge
able vibrators now come 

with a lock feature to 
help prevent any sudden 
vibrating in your bag 
lubricants will go by 
the same 311 rule as other liquids 

meaning that a bottle may contain no 

more than 34 ounces all containers 
must t into one onequart plastic bag 
and each traveler is allowed only one 

of these bags other carryon approved 

toys include handcus rope strapon 

harnesses and other products made of 
leather fabric or buckles 
ere are some toys that t into 
a grey area and may be best to put 

into your checked baggage ese 
include whips paddles and electrical 

stimulants riding whips and crops 
are approved for carry on while whips 
and bullwhips are considered defense 

equipment and must be placed in 

checked baggage when it comes 

to paddles pingpong paddles are 
approved for carry on in this case 
comparing your paddles size to that of 
pingpong paddles can help you decide 
what is better le checked electri

cal stimulants that are used for pain 

treatment are acceptable in carryons 

however the rules on stunguns are a 
little hazy so your violet wand may be 
better le checked you are better o 

to check any items made of stainless 
steel or glass 
items that absolutely cannot go in 
your carry on are those with sharp 
edges or points its probably best to 
check that sexy spiked collar and those 

that are similar in size shape or weight 

to clubs bats or batons e 17inch 
dildo your friends got you as a prank is 
best le in your checked baggage 
discussing the vibrator that a secu
rity worker has found in your bag can 

be nervewracking however many 
modern vibrators come 

in such odd shapes and 
such a wide variety of col
ors that their appearance 
doesnt automatically 
categorize them as a sex 
toy ere are also several 

terms you can use to de
scribe it besides vibrator 
you can call it a personal 
device or personal toy 

you can reserve the right 
to be screened in private which can 

allow for a search and discussion of 

carryon contents without calling atten
tion to yourself from other travelers if 

nothing else you can always check your 

toys and save yourself the stress of the 

security line if you are traveling within 

the us you can most likely nd an 
inexpensive vibrator at a pharmacy at 
your destination whatever happens 

tell the truth when asked about the 
nature of your carryon items its a 
good idea to place your toys in plastic 

bags so security workers can see what it 
is without contaminating it 
another thing to be aware of when 
traveling with personal devices are the 
laws of your destination alabama is 

currently the only state with a legal ban 
on all sex toys many other countries 
have bans on personal devices make 
sure to do a little pretravel research to 
know what is and isnt okay for travel

indie games that may have 
own under the radarby adam waldorf
you know games like cod fallout and 
halo
e games people play from day to daylo
but there are always some games that go 
undetected
ey are usually quite good which can be 
unsuspected
eyre usually family friendly and not very 
gory
so why dont these indie games ever get any 
glory
better stand by because im about to drop 
some knowledge
about some great games you may have missed 
while at college 
ori and the blind forest
from the rst cutscene  which had me 
curled up in the fetal position trying not to 
cry  i knew ori and the blind forest was 

going to be amazing even with my expecta
tions i was impressed e game looked 

and controlled perfectly in ori you play 

as a small ratlooking thing e light has 
disappeared in the forest and it is your job 
to bring it back by roaming through the map 

to nd trees and the elements to a forest now 

rendered blind 
e game begins simply enough with a but
ton to jump and a button to attack but as you 

progress through the game you unlock more 
powers which make the game more complex 
ese range from being able to jump from en
emy to enemy without touching the ground 

to being able to smash through logs or being 
able to glide e game progresses well and 
will keep you hooked until the end it is high 

on my list for best game of the year

lovers in a dangerous spacetime
in lovers in a dangerous spacetime 
you work with a friend to control a space
ship while this may sound simple it can 
be very complex and nerveracking the 
ship has different compartments that 

control what the ship does one compart
ment can control the ship while another 
will fire the guns or deploy the shields 

while doing this hoards of enemies are 
constantly attacking threatening the life of 
your ship and attempting to send the crew 

to a vacuumy spacedeath it takes strategy 

to plan out how you and your partner will 
defeat the enemies and it wont work all 
the time while a simple concept lovers

undertale
in the days of the super nintendo there 
was a game that was overlooked by many 

gamers but as time progressed more and 

more players started to flock to it this 

game was earthbound now over twenty 
years later we have undertale an 8bit 
rpg that is overflowing with similarities to 

earthbound in undertale you control 
a human who falls below the ground into 
a world inhabited by monsters as this 

human you need to maneuver the under
ground world to escape or be trapped down 
there forever where you will ultimately 
meet your demise 
the gameplay of undertale is similar 
to many rpgs of the same type where you 

maneuver through the landscapes and fight 

enemies and random times there are a 

variety of moves you can use to fight these 
enemies and they become progressively 
more powerful as you advance through the 

game undertales story is where it shines 
it mixes an intriguing plot with a slew of 
fresh humor to give the player a fantastic 

gaming experience undertale will have 

you smiling throughout its campaign until 
it decides to rip your heart into a thousand 
pieces towards the games conclusion
undertale is available on pc for 10

19cheap vino the good the bad and the ugly
is weeks vinoth
que poised at the be
ginning of nals is craed to help you cope 
with the threering hell circus that your life 

has become and also cheaply facilitate your 

endofyearendoftimes celebrations so 

put your pinky down and grab a cup because 

these wines dont require a glass
to make some good recommendations 
i decided to lasso two friends emily and 

natalie into helping me try a small array 

of bargain basement bottom bottom shelf 

wines that might be the rst pick for a college 

student en we put bottlebox to mouth 

and scored on a 10point scale
searidge chardonnay 439          
 rating 8  4 after 60 seconds
drink quickly because it only gets worse

is undervedollar white wine opened 
surprisingly not terrible it presented with 

a unique bouquet of apple bubblegum e 

bottle described it as having hints of tropi

cal fruit citrus and butterscotch but the 

immediate leading tasting note we got was that 

it tasted well like generic wine i think its 

wine noted natalie however our initial mild 

satisfaction quickly dissipated youll want to 

knock it back aer about a minute because 

soon it was like drinking balsamic vinegar
barefoot pinot noir 569          
 rating 01  12 after 5 minutes
bad is the rst word that comes to mind

at was an insult i exclaimed my face 
twisted from the liquid assault is wine pre
sented with an aroma that would be expected 

from a bottle of linoleum cleaner it smelled 

like grape pinesol and tasted worse e label 

suggested that this ne product is perfect 

with lamb but who on earth buys lamb and 

then pairs it with a vedollar pinot to be 

honest id rather take this wine as an enema 

it just doesnt taste like something you should 

be drinking natalie agreed i noted that it 

tasted like decent wine that had been con
sumed and then regurgitated maybe thats 

what it is natalie suggested bile 
as with some of the other wines this one 
also experienced degradation over time and 

it was extraordinary now it smells how it 

tasted and tastes like butthole a keen natalie 

observed ve minutes aer opening the 

bottle it had acquired a palate that i can only 

describe as welches that hadnt passed the 

quality assurance test and was then fermented 

in a dorm fridge its a struggle natalie said 

to imagine pausing again in disbelief nish
ing this glass starting to feel a buzz we both 

agreed that it wasnt ethanol intoxication but 

brain damage ive enjoyed eating actual dirt 

more than this at least no one expects you to 

dirty a glass with this mysterious purple liquid 

because whats the point we recommend the 

barefoot pinot as a breakup wine give it to 

people you dont want to talk to anymore
crane lake pinot 
grigio 439          
 rating 7
i could get drunk o this

opening up similarly to the chard this 
one lacked the rapid decay it tastes fresh o 

the vine noted natalie is is like water 

e crane lake had a surprisingly appetiz

ing aroma of cinnamon raisin bread it sort 

of tasted like some collegiate party host got 

the bright idea to mix diluted apple juice 

and vodka which somehow had a banana 

aertaste aer a number of minutes we 

noted that this eversoslightly carbonated 

oddity was beginning to taste like gasoline 

and smell like regret and wonder bread ac

cording to emily so we quickly moved on
vendage 
white zinfandel 289          
 rating 2
a big mouthful will make you shiver
perhaps the most glowing endorse
ment for this boxed wine was when emily 

shamelessly expressed this is what im 

used to before topping off her glass im 
not mad about it she added however 

for me and natalie this wine induced that 

visceral i shouldnt put this in my mouth 

response you learn as a toddler it smells 

like raspberry syrup it feels like its caus

ing neuronal harm it tastes like nothing 

in particular that id like to taste and the 

burps are awful we noted that the box 

doesnt say definitively if the liquid inside 

is actually made from grapes it certainly 

doesnt live up to the claims of sweet and 

juicy with notes of strawberry and jasmine 

on the box but really a box wine claiming 

jasmine as a tasting note probably should 

not be trusted if youre looking for a box 

wine or any wine for that matter id 

probably avoid this one
tisdale cabernet sauvignon 339          
 rating 3
is wine really concerns me
aer having our taste buds permanently 
chemically altered by the barefoot product 

it was amazing that we could taste anything 

but we pushed on to this remarkably cheap 

bottle immediately aer pouring a splash i 

looked up in utter shock is wine smells 

savory e lasting rst impression was an 

aroma of meat and chemicals e confus

ing aroma made it very dicult to drink and 

inhaling anywhere near the glass felt like 

hung paint e rst halfsecond with the 

wine in my mouth was surprisingly decent 

it tasted like unfermented grape juice but it 

quickly turned into what i imagine drink
ing clorox is like e everoptimistic read 

classless and desperate emily however 

oered id take shots of this before taking 

a gulp

insuring littlefoot mor required to report value of its collections
by 
lilly b
rogg
erit would be difficult to guess the mon
etary value on the museum of the rock
ies mor collections as putting a dollar 
value on oneofakind collections and 
paleontological pieces is not a straight
forward process this is an issue the mor 
is currently dealing with as the state 
demands a more accurate insurance value 
be calculated for all of the items housed 
there
 the states risk management tort de
fense division insures all universityowned 

collectionstheir fine arts insurance pro
gram requires that all entities annually re
port the market value for insured items in 
january 2015 msu reported an approxi
mate value of 60 million for the items in 
its permanent collection the montana 

legislative audit divisions report states 
the university was not able to provide us 
with documentation supporting the 60 
million estimated value of exhibited and 
stored items 
the state then asked that msu provide 
this documentation the recommenda
tion for the mor is one of 12 made by the 

states legislative audit division for msu 
all of which were presented in november 
to the montana board of regents these 
audits are routine but the challenge lies 
in figuring out how to actually value 
the items being insured the montana 
legislative audits report stated that an 

adequately documented insurance value is 
necessary to prevent the university from 
underinsuring the collection which could 
result in being unable to make up for a 
loss or overinsuring the collection which 

would cause unnecessary insurance costs
msu is currently working on calculating 
accurate values for items but is also trying 
to balance other commitments quickly 
calculating an accurate value for the entire 
mor collection would take a large amount 
of resources daniel adams director of 

audit services at msu coordinates be
tween msu and the states audit division 

he explained that msu is going to take 

its time to determine a value in order to 
efficiently allocate its resources as well as 
to do an accurate job of valuing the items 

you dont want to figure it out in a hurry 
because sometimes you might get into 

something and it may be different from 
what you originally think said adams
for historical items comparison may be 
used to derive market values for example 
the montana historical society museum 
has many items comparable to those at the 

mor the controversy about the audits 

arose largely in response to putting values 

on paleontological items these are more 

difficult to compare and have raised ques

tions of morality
shelley mckamey the executive director 
at the mor says that the question the 
state brought up about valuing the items

new football coach choate 
prepares for an exciting yearan unconventional journey the 
unfolding of peter buerhaus career
by s
eth urick
football has been an important part of 
je choates life for a long time he gradu
ated from university of montanawestern 
in dillon in 1993 where he played football 

in december 2015 he was hired as msus 
32nd head football coach following the 
ring of former head coach rob ash in the 
past choate coached at the high school 

and collegiate levels and held positions at 
universities including utah state university 
eastern illinois university the university of 
idaho and washington state university
according to choate he has always 
wanted to lead a college football program 

on top of that he wanted to coach in the 
big sky conference due to the strong ties 
he has to montana
ive wanted to be a head coach at the 
big sky level for a while and ive had a 
chance to coach at some unbelievable 

locations all it really did was galvanize 
the idea that what i wanted to do was be a 
head coach at a place like montana state 
choate said
choates interest led him to reach out 
to msu when they began the process of 
hiring a new head coach
i certainly didnt know peter fields or 
dr cruzado or anybody in the athletic 
department i knew some of the football 
coaches because football coaches get 
around each other and its a big fraternity 
but i didnt know any of the decisionmak
ers he said what i tried to do was use 

what i had which was a lot of connections 
mostly in the high school ranks in the state 
of montana to reach out to people that did 
know folks in the athletic administration 
here 
you push your resume out there and 
sometimes it falls on deaf ears and in this 

particular case it got put high enough on 
the stack that i got a call for the interview
since taking the position choate has 
hired several new members for his coach
ing sta including exnfl safety gerald 

alexander as a defensive backs coach and 
former head coach of umwestern bj 
roberts as an assistant coach
i feel extremely fortunate when i sit 
in that sta room and i look around and 
i look at the experience and the character 
of the people in there and i think is is 
a place id want my son to play because i 
know the kind of guys that are in the room 
and how theyre going to treat these kids 
and how hard theyre going to work to help 
them achieve their goals choate said
is isnt je choates football program 
this is montana state universitys football 
program and it belongs to our players and 

my job is to do everything i can to make 

their experience here really good at starts 

with hiring good people to work with them 

every day i think we have accomplished 

that and i am really proud of that
acknowledging that there would be 
dierences between his approach and that 
of ash choate said i think there was a 
good culture here its not good or bad 

right or wrong its just dierent i have a 

very dierent style than coach ash my 

background is very dierent than coach 

ash and so i am going to create the culture 

that we as a sta feel like we are comfort
able with so thats been a big part of what 

were doing its not changing work habits 

so much as how we do things
choate expressed his appreciation for 
the work ash did to keep keep athletes 
in the football program out of trouble 
saying that the recruiting process is key 
to ensuring that athletes who are brought 
into the program are young men that have 

values that are reected by this program 

character accountability toughness pride 

in msu those are things that we gotta 

really hone in on in the recruiting process 

e education they get across campus is 

an unbelievably rstclass education but 

theyre going to get another one here in 

this building in terms of how to be a real 

man how to treat women how to conduct 

yourself in public and in private how to es

tablish a set of values you want to live your 
life by ose are the things that are really 
important to me and our program and i 
know were important to coach ash too

peter buerhaus of msus college of 
nursing detailed his unconventional 
journey before an audience of students 

reporters and fellow nurses alike on tuesday 

jan 19 buerhaus lecture consisted of the six 

main stops along his career which led to 
him being a professor of nursing at vander
bilt university before taking on the same 
role at montana state in addition to having 
served as an assistant professor of health 
policy and management at harvards school 

of public health
e rst stop of buerhaus commend
able career began with acknowledging a 

pressing problem in the nursing commu
nity the generation of nurses that provided 
healthcare to the babyboom generation 
were going to retire taking away one mil
lion registered nurses from the healthcare 

workforce with a shortage of 500000 le in 

the country by the year 2020 only a week 

aer conducting studies and having them 

published in prestigious medical journals 

buerhaus quickly progressed to stop two 

when he participated in 75 media inter
views allowing him and his work to gain 
worldwide exposure
stop three in buerhaus work consisted 
of providing sucient evidence that sug
gested a positive correlation between the 
amount of nurse stang and the quality 

of care given at hospitals his study which 

was one of the top twenty studies funded 

by the department of health and human 

services showed that higher nurse stang 

in hospitals drastically lowered the risk of 
negative discharge outcomes in the patients 
of those hospitals e study led to him be
ing featured on 60 minutes
buerhaus fourth and h stops in 
his career were helping with johnson  
johnsons campaign for nursings future 

and the founding of the national health
care workforce commission nhwc in 

2010 respectively e nhwcs job was 

to advise congress and the administration 

on issues concerning the national nursing 
workforce focusing specically on aging 
healthcare workers rural healthcare dental 
and mental health care services and to de
crease the overall cost of american health 
care finally the sixth stop buerhaus men
tioned is the current work of the nhwc 

e nhwc is concerning itself with help
ing physicians and nurses themselves with 

focus on things like allowing physicians to 

practice in the location of their choice
predicting a global shortage of goods 
or services due to population growth is no 

new concept however due to his world

impacting work buerhaus has been com
pared to omas malthus a famous 
eng
lish cleric of the 1700s malthus predicted 

that due to the rapidly growing population 

and marginally improving standards of 

living of that time that there would be a 

food shortage that would eventually cause 
the living standard to drop back down
ward buerhaus was compared to malthus 

because of how his healthcare predictions 
mirrored those of the old cleric the rapid 

decline in healthcare quality with the 

decrease in nurses
nurses are present at birth throughout 
life and during ones passing e opportu
nity to contribute to ones health and their 

potential as a human being throughout 
their lifetime appeals to me nurses can 
create enormously positive ripple eects

loud noise coming from a residence 

on you guessed it julia martin

on jan 1
 an ocer assisted 
the bozeman police department 

in looking for an individual who 

was reported to have threatened 

someone with a shotgun however 

there is no cause for alarm because 

this individual is probably a respon

gun owners only use their guns for 

hunting and other legal things and 

they would never use their deadly

more medicine more money how much med school really costs
ever since november 2015 the bozeman 
daily chronicle has been extensively 
covering a rumored new medical college 

at msu a deal which president waded 

cruzado ocially stated fell through in an 

ambiguous email she sent out to 

the entire faculty and student body 

on dec 15 
even though cru
zados administrators were deep 

into talks the deal fell through 

because of according to cruzados 

email concerns expressed by some 

physicians in the state and that 

is about all there is to the email 

which is extremely unfortunate 

because it adds to the notion that 

the presidents oce does not really care to 

communicate with the general population of 

the school when they do not have to
e emails content raises more questions 
than answers  the most obvious being why 

the concerns raised by experts caused the 

project to fall apart it seems that they do 

not want to go into detail about this for a 

good reason as there are not enough posi

tions at hospitals and clinics in montana 

to accommodate an inux of new medical 

students 
especially considering the fact that 
most graduates will not want to work at the 

hospitals that need the most help specically 

poorer and more rural that cannot aord to 

pay them what they would need to pay o 

the proposed 46000 per year tuition debt
cruzado did not seem to have this student 
centered approach in mind when she wrote 

a guest article for the chronicle and the 

oce of the presidents lack of transparency 

in this plan makes them seem less righteous 
and more nefarious at may be 

harsh aer all msu is an institu
tion whose overall goal is to make 

money even if it should not be 

that way an institution of educa
tion should have education as its 

rst and foremost goal especially 

when said institution is an entity 

of the government unfortunately 

that is not the message the current 

administration is sending about 
their goals 
cruzado and her administration may 
have entirely dierent goals in mind ones 

that do have students forefront of their 

concerns but if montana hall administra
tion wants students to think that then they 

and cruzado specically have to be more 

transparent about what is going on with the 

institution otherwise people are put in the 

position they are in now where they are le 

wondering if msu was in talks with burrell 

college of osteopathic medicine purely for 

monetary reasons 
if cruzado and the rest of the administra
tion want to show the students and faculty 

at msu that they care about them they 

should be worrying about improving areas 
of neglect on campus and not just try to 

squeeze more money out of the students 

e diversity awareness oce for instance 

is in a tiny closet of a workspace on the third 

oor of the sub but at this point it seems 

like its asking for too much to give them a 

proper oce space when instead the admin
istration could just vote to build yet another 

engineering building with grant money        
e exponent reached out to the oce of 
the president for comment and was referred 

to the communication department who 

at the time of publication have yet to return 

with comment
every year americans commit to improv
ing themselves at the beginning of the 
new year at resolve lasts about as long as 

most college students goal to study more and 

netix less e whole idea of new 

years resolutions is pretty much 
a copout for those who lack the 

resolve to commit to life changes 

without a massive cultural move
ment one would hope that aer 

years of unfullled goals people 

would abandon the redundant and 

inane tradition of resolutions for 

something more feasible alas last 

years resolution to campaign against folly 

petered out aer the rst couple weeks
about 44 percent of americans said they 
would make resolutions with the beginning 

of 2016 of those over a quarter of them will 

give up their resolutions by the end of the 
rst week is is one of the primary reasons 

new 
years resolutions are counterproduc
tive it is as if americans decide well hey 

i forgot to go to the gym today  i guess ill 
try again in 362 days us end 

the wellintentioned goals of so 

many e problem with trying to 

reinvent oneself at the dawn of a 

new year is that a special signi

cance is tied to the date and not to 

the objective july 22 is just as valid 

of a day to stop smoking as jan 1
unfortunately society has come 
to view mistakes as failures in a 
study conducted by the university of scran
ton only 19 percent of the testers had kept 

their resolution aer two years during that 

time 53 percent of those who successfully 

kept their resolution made at least one slip 

up with the average being 14 slipups per 
person ese did not prevent the partici

pants from completing their goal as they 

still considered themselves successful aer 

two years ey simply had to look at their 

game plan in a new way
e biggest mistake made with new 
years 
resolutions is creating vague and impracti

cal goals a survey conducted in december 

2014 indicated that the top four resolutions 

were to lose weight exercise more be a 

better person and improve health ese all 

sound great if this pattern continued be
yond the rst seven days of the year north 

america could potentially be a wonderland 

of healthy upbeat people in reality all of 

those aspirations involve a lot more work 

and planning than hastily scrawled reso
lutions would indicate a google trend 

search shows that there is a huge spike in 

the number of times people enter diet and 
gym into google during january a number 

which steadily declines until the following 

january gyms make so much money during 

the beginning of the year because people 

buy memberships they will use a few times 

before their commitment peters out and 

what physical manifestations prove the 

relative success of those attempting to be 

better people 
ere are more practical ways of growing 
into the person one intends to be any day 

of the school year one can make use of the 

free gym membership paid for by tens of 

thousands of tuition dollars it is possible 

to smile more today even if yesterday an 

organic chemistry test became an impromp
tu tissue for tears of regret and inevitable 

failure is year resolve to do whatever you 

want for however long you want for what
ever results you are willing to work for

both a new semester and new 
year are underway leaving msu 
students faced with a new set of chal
lenges one of which is being present
ed with the opportunity to determine 
the countrys next leader 
  with open socialist bernie sanders lead
ing over former first lady and 

secretary of state hillary clinton 
among younger voters on the 
democratic side and billionaire 

celebrity donald trump leading 

overall on the republican side 
the presidential campaign is quite 
engrossing to say the least largely 

perceived as a pivotal political 

point per primary presidential 

and public polls standards the 2016 cam
paign demands a highly active and highly 

informed voting populace 
from womens rights education and taxes 
to global warming national debt universal 

healthcare and immigration the united 
states is in line for one of its most progressive 
or regressive periods in decades while 
elec
tion day may still seem a long way out there 

are numerous things to keep in mind before 
the calendars start reading november
first and foremost as a voting populace 
the student body should be aware of who the 
presidential candidates are and which end of 

the political spectrum they represent is 

may at rst seem silly but odds are a signi
cant portion of the student body 

cannot identify each of the dozen 

republican and three democratic 

candidates still in the race beyond 

just knowing the names every 

voter has a responsibility to gain an 

understanding of the policies and 

plans of each candidate 
financially burdened busy and 
frequently overwhelmed it is oen 
easier for students to allow someone else to 

form their political opinions without ac
cess to television or time to spare reviewing 
countless debates and conferences students 

tend to establish their political perspectives 

based on ease of access memes circulating 

facebook 140 character slanderous twitter 

statements judgmental inclass discussions 

etc e fact is that it is easier to believe the 

political statements of a friend coworker 

or professor than it is to verify the validity 

of those statements students should neither 
allow those around them to discount their 

informed judgments nor base their beliefs on 

popular opinion with that in mind there 

are some other things to consider throughout 

the year
when considering the 2016 presidential 
campaign it is important to understand the 

major national issues and where to stand 

on them is will help in identifying what 

things to look for in a candidate aer all 

these are the people who will potentially 

represent the voter and their stance some 

of the more important things student vot
ers should take into consideration include 

where candidates stand on education and 

their plans for the job market
informed voters are not limited to cable 
subscribers ere is no need to watch 

hours of debates to research candidates and 

their political backgrounds or plans 
every 
student has access to the internet through 

msu and the resources therein to help with 

gaining political insight sites like the con
servative review isidewith and ballotpe
dia oer proles on each candidate with 

details regarding their stances on major 
political issues 
isidewithcom
 can also help 
with determining which candidate best 

represents the voter based on the results of 
a short quiz regarding national issues
additionally constituents should not 
limit themselves to voting for the indi
vidual for many voters no single candi
date may be appealing should voters nd 
themselves in this position it may be best 
to vote for a party instead of the indi

vidual ough the president denitely has 
inuence and acts as our countrys main 
representative congress has constitutional 

powers that can better meet the demands of 
a constituency than the president mainly 
in its authority to make laws however a 

vote for the party line could determine the 
upcoming political landscape in that the 
next president may appoint as many as four 
supreme court justices which would de
termine the future legal status of hot issues 
such as abortion and samesex marriage
finally every voter should know both 
where to vote and whether they are cur
rently registered to do so polling locations 
were recently changed from campus to 
hope lutheran church as msus nearest 

polling place msu students can check 
the montana secretary of state website for 
additional information on voting locations 

and eligibility as well as their registration 
status

while the entire msu campus 
cleared out for winter break the 
mens basketball team was busy 

battling to close out the season with 

a winning record historically the 

cats dont fare well in the winter 

months and fall susceptible to a 

harsh losing streak that seems to 

plague the team for the remainder 

of the semester e cats went 2 

for 6 last season during december 

unfortunately the cats found 

themselves once again falling prey 

to the cold streak for this season 

as well managing only to win 2 of 

their 7 matchups e cats closed 

out december with a 79 overall 

record with 2016 just around the 

corner the cats new 
years resolu
tion was to achieve a winning re
cord of course like the 90 percent 

of new 
years resolutions broken 
by jan 2 so was the cats and 

theyve got a lot more work to do to 
procure that winning record aer 

backtoback losses in the opening 

week of the 2016 season e team 

nished up the rst week of spring 

semester with backtoback loses on 

the road putting them at an overall 

record of 711 
eir rst matchup last urs
day jan 14 saw the team traveling 

to grand forks to go headtohead 

with north dakota going into the 

game north dakota possessed a 

78 record facing o with was a 79 

bobcats e cats were outscored 

in the rst half falling into a 10 

point decit of 2839 i thought 

we were locked in and ready to 

play said bobcat head coach bri

an fish but we missed some shots 

early eir point guard made three 

or four shots we just struggled to 

get something going is set the 

precedent for the rest of the game 

the cats never surpassing north 

dakotas lead montana state fell 

to 710 overall 23 in the big sky 
with the loss north dakota is now 

88 32 e cats then traveled to 
greeley colorado to face the 

bears e hectic last nine seconds 
against the bears in the 4th quar
ter will forever be imprinted in 

senior marcus colberts mind he 

took the nal shot to tie the game 

but missed even aer a tip attempt 
by freshman tyler hall to seal 

the shot e cats had scrabbled 

back from an eight point decit  

tying the score with 39 seconds 

to play on a threepoint shot he 

was fouled and converted the free 

throw uncs jeremy verhagen 

made a pair of free throws with 26 

seconds to play to set up msus 

nal possession which ended with 

the failed shot attempt to tie
our eort has been good all 
along fish said but we have to 

get some stops 
you cant allow 60 
percent shooting in the second 

half and you cant put the other 

team at the line as many times as 

we do and win on the road
hall totaled 37 points over the 
past two games raising his season 

total to 320 making him the fastest 

bobcat to ever reach 300 total points 

with the two backtoback losses the 

mens team will come back home to 

face a 98 
eastern washington in the 
brick on ursday jan 21

womens basketball ignites semester with pair of home wins
by ian br
eun
ere montana state bobcats womens 
basketball team  had a hot start to the spring 
semester defeating both the university of 

north dakota and university of northern 

colorado at home in worthington arena 
e bobcats faced o against the fighting 
hawks of north dakota on jan 14 north 

dakota scored the rst four points of the 

game but the cats only allowed the fighting 

hawks to score eight total rst period points 

and took a 138 lead at the end of the rst 

period despite being outsized at the center 

position msu did a great job shutting down 
the fighting hawks post play 
we established some tempo in the open 
court and used our speed to our advantage 
msu head coach tricia binford said 
seniors lindsay stockton and jasmine hom
mes got things started in the rst couple 

minutes of the second period and stretched 
the lead to doubledigit gures with the score 

at 199 e bobcats led 3421 at the end of 

the rst half 
hommes continued her hot shooting in 
the second half establishing the cats largest 
lead of 16 points with another triple a couple 
minutes into the third e fighting hawks 

outscored the bobcats 4035 in the second 
half but were unable to cut the lead under 
eight give them some credit binford said i 
thought north dakota had a really challeng
ing second half and made it a really back and 
fourth game hommes led the cats in scoring 
with 20 points while sophomore hannah 
caudill added 17 points e bobcats cruised 
to a 6961 win over the fighting hawks
e cats battled the bears of northern 
colorado on saturday jan 16 msu had 
a sizzling start converting unc turnovers 

into easy buckets and took an early 198 lead 
in the rst period e bears came out in the 
second period and outscored the cats 1714 

and cut the lead to eight points e bobcats 

led 3325 at the half 
e bobcats didnt score until almost seven 
minutes into the third period and the bears 

used this to their advantage and cut the lead 
to four before the cats stretched out the 
lead to seven at the end of the period junior 

peyton ferris helped to ignite the bobcats 

oense in the fourth quarter scoring both 
from the three point line as well as in the 
paint as the bobcats secured a 6658 win over 
the bears ferris led the cats in scoring with 
24 points and hommes added 13 points 

e bobcats improved to 60 in the big sky

er w
ebbwhile volunteering at the 
khumbu climbing center in ne
pal i lived for roughly two months 
underneath tawoche a mountain 

in every sense of the word tawoche 

stretches to a height of 21463 feet 

swallowing the sky above the village 

of phortse 
everywhere i went i 
couldnt escape its grasp  spanning 

the horizon with an immense face 

of rock and ice capped with seracs 

into a pyramidal summit seem
ingly unattainable to me it seems 

impossible to climb a mountain 

people would only dream of climb
ing a summit of dreams not of 

actuality for others that has not 

been the case for local climber and 

superhero justin grin tawoche 

wasnt just a gment of inspiration 

  just a jagged tooth cutting into 

the mind to be dreamed of being 

climbed for justin it was an actual 

objective over the course of nov 

814 it was an objective and goal 

that justin along with climber skiy 

detray attained 
yet unfortunate
ly this dream was attained at the 
cost of justins life while descend
ing from their rst ascent justin 

slipped dying in the fall for the 

climbing community of bozeman 

the news hit hard superheroes 

dont die eyre not supposed to 

anyways
 over the course of the years ive 
been climbing enough friends of 

mine have passed away in the out
doors to ll the ngers on one hand 

luke benton kevin volkening 

dendi sherpa jens anderson and 

justin grin im not alone with 

this given enough time almost ev
eryone has the unfortunate chance to 

lose someone close to them through 

events taking place in the outdoors 

in places that give us so much joy and 

drive our lives e games we play in 

the mountains are dangerous ones 

games with severe consequences as 

invincible as we see ourselves to be 

especially as college students trying 

to impress the crew we shred or 

climb with death is still a possibil
ity in the outdoors perhaps not the 

most prevalent risk all the time  a 

sprained ankle or a broken bone is a 

lot more likely while sport climbing 
or mountain biking  but death is 

still a possibility
with such a looming risk of 
death it begs the question is 

it worth it with the games we 

play do the rewards outweigh the 

risks in most cases the answer 

is it depends conditional on 

the perceived risk versus actual 

risk and it is different for each 

person and each setting a short 

answer would be no that dying 

in the mountains is never worth 

it but as alpinist kelly cordes 

has said people die every day 

without living is a life lived on 

the couch in fear where death is 

just as inevitable any more worth 

it than living a life full of passion 

im not telling you to go do the 

riskiest most dangerous thing you 

can instead im asking you to 

take a deep look at your life and 

the sports you participate in and 

truly decide for yourselves what 

activities are worth the risk live 

a life full of passion and dreams 

yet live it to your accounts 
exist 

passionately and dont forget to 

check your knot

by th
eodor
e grov
erdespite the lies the ski area might be 
telling you theres really not a lot of snow 
here right now thats what the wiry old 

whitewater local said to us in the parking 

lot that morning as we slapped our skins 

on our skis it was early december and the 

surrounding mountains were already caked 

in snow the resort was claiming some
thing like a 75 inch base on the summit in 

early december no less but i guess thats 
not a lot of snow for a place like white
water it was our second day exploring the 
selkirk mountains that surround the town 

of nelson british columbia and i was 

enthralled i turned to my friend dan and 

said i think i want to move here 
just a few miles up the road from sleepy 
nelson lies whitewater ski resort a 

quirky little ski area with absolutely ripping 

terrain and a stellar vibe to boot white
water along with roughly a dozen other 
ski areas scattered across the west make 
up the powder alliance this collection of 
resorts offers three free days of shredding at 

other member resorts respectively all one 

has to do to take advantage of the powder 

alliance is possess a season pass at one of 

the participating resorts and bridger bowl 

just happens to be one of them 
taking advantage of free lift tickets we 
spent the first day of our trip skiing at the 

resort proper the resort did not disap
point we hopped on the double chair 

at opening bell a rickety old chair that 

climbed up whitewaters steep lower face 

all the way to the summit six inches of 
fresh snow had fallen the night before and 

we were excited to see what terrain the 
mountain had to offer we ripped the lift 
line under the double for our first run a 

steep cliffridden trail the grade of the 

slope was impressive pushing 45 degrees in 

places and skied phenomenally well with 

the fresh snowfall on the next run we set 

out to explore some of whitewaters leg
endary glades the mountain is covered in 

towering thin pine trees making for some 

astonishingly good tree skiing that morn
ing we had the fine privilege of sampling 

just how good the trees at whitewater 

are as we floated down through the silent 

pines popping off pillows as we went 
the next morning we set out to explore 
some of the fabulous backcountry terrain 
that surrounds the resort some friendly 

old locals that we met in the parking lot 

pointed us in the right direction and we 

were soon skinning up through beautiful 
bc trees we eventually gained the ridge 

that sits opposite the resort offering up 

majestic views of the surrounding selkirk 

mountains further skinning along the 

ridge brought us to the top of a large glad
ed meadow where we proceeded to dig a 
pit before dropping in by the time we dug 
to the ground the snow was over my head 

there mustve been 80 inches of snow sit
ting at the top of the ridge i thought back 

to what the timeworn whitewater local 

had said to us in the parking lot and had 

to chuckle someday ill have to return to 

whitewater to see what a lot of snow looks 

like as i can imagine that it must be pretty 

incredible 
we had the ne privilege of sampling just how good the 
trees at 
whitewater are as we oated down through the 
silent pines popping off pillows as we went

 herefive ways to enjoy winter in montana
by nick kass
eri live in the mountains ey say home 
is where the heart is and although i may 
sleep in a building my heart is up high with 

windswept pines and perennial snowcapped 

peaks my brain is on rivers and sticks in 

spots where the river bends and big sh like 

to hide my eyes are on new lures and shing 

reports and the sunset
we in montana especially in bozeman 
are blessed with some of the greatest scenery 

and outdoor opportunities in the world it 

can be easy to forget this when that beauty is 

marred by dirty gray slush in the streets and 

fog clouding the sky all day its even easier 

when your car wont start your door sticks 

you slip and slide everywhere and its so cold 

your face hurts so here are some ways to 

embrace the harsh montana winter and get 

back in touch with one of the most beautiful 

places on 
earth
ice fishingi know ive talked about this before 
but there really cant ever be too much 

encouragement for it 
especially if youre 
already an avid fisherman 
you can buy a 
hand crank auger for 50 bucks or better 

yet borrow one from a buddy and if 

youre willing to invest in a shelter youll 

be way more comfortable ice fishing is 

relaxing and you can even do homework 

while you wait for the fish to bite 
even 
in the dead of winter you have the chance 

to catch absolute monsters and its an 

incredible experience to fish on top of a 

frozen lake wearing a life vest or float
ing coveralls is a good idea and always 

make sure the ice is safe to fish before 

going out
skiing and snowboarding
obviously no explanation needed for this 
one
snowmobiling
is is the wintertime version of four
wheeling tons of fun just make sure you 
bundle up i did this once as a kid and made 

the mistake of not wearing proper cloth
ing needless to say i got cold real fast and 

my trip didnt last as long as it should have 

ere are places around here to rent snow
mobiles and there are even more places to 

ride them ask around and youre likely to 

nd someone very knowledgeable on the 

subject its a great way to enjoy the natural 

beauty without having to hike for miles as 

for rentals try summit all terrain rentals or 

big boy toys
hiking or snowshoeing
brave the cold and enjoy the days of sun
shine ere are tons of trails all around boz
eman and hiking in the snow is a great way 

to stay in shape and see some wonderful snow 

covered vistas who needs the gym when 
youre climbing to six thousand feet in snow 

up to your knees talk about cardio and just 

because its cold doesnt mean you cant enjoy 

the hike just be extra careful of hypothermia 

and frostbite which can set in in broad day
light especially if youre sweating msu will 

rent you snowshoes at the outdoor rec center 

and you can buy all sorts of cleat attachments 

for your shoes if to wear when its icy
watch the sunset hot cocoa or 
cider in hande sunset is beautiful no paint or camera 
on 
earth can capture the sort of color that a 
winter sunset puts o it reminds me that i 
am part of a much larger universe and that 

universe is much greater than just me 
even 
in the dead of winter i love sitting on my 

deck in a lawnchair and watching the sun go 

down
good luck with the new semester heres 
wishing you all lots of as and little work

arts never been a decision  its just 
always been what i wanted to do  msu 
senior and art student muriel condon said 
in preparation for the opening of her exhibit 

oh wind e exhibit will be the rst of 

the semester in the 
exit gallery and its artist 

is both nervous and excited for the chance to 

showcase her work
condon a bozeman native grew up in and 
around bozeman livingston and paradise 

valley before nally graduating from bozeman 

high school from the time she was a young 

child to now art has always been a major part 

of her life i dont remember ever starting to 

like art  i just always did condon said
her passion for art led her to msu where 
she is currently dualfocused in painting and 

printmaking her 
exit gallery exhibit consists 
of a collection of handprinted curtains suf
ce to say the work is incredibly unique as is 

the meaning behind it
i wanted to play with curtains being a lter 
of light a barrier of light condon said i 
like talking about the separation of experience 
between mental or spiritual and the physical a 

lot of the stu i printed on the curtains is body 
imagery and really simple symbolism towards 
that  symbolism of deconstructing experience
each piece in oh wind is literally a curtain 
 as in the curtains one nds hanging on rods 
over windows in almost any domestic living 
situation you can imagine of course condons 

curtains are a little more special than your average 
drapery 
each features a handprinted design 
and while some of the curtains were found and 
purchased others were handsewn in the case 
of the handsewn curtains condon selected the 
fabric based on its translucency and the way it 

plays with light positioned behind each curtain 
is a line drawing done in semigloss white paint 
 these drawings can only be seen when a viewer 

walks past and the light hits it just right
condon enjoyed the opportunity to work 
with fabric i like the saying the fabric of 

dna and how its woven together con
don said i like the idea of small segments 

creating one unied piece just like cells in the 

human body or the thread in fabric
condon also really wanted to do an instal
lation that played with light when that idea 
combined with the curtains the concept for 

oh wind really began to take shape
what i wanted to do with the curtains is 
make people aware of the dierence between the 

physicality of the curtains and the intangibility 
of the light and try to connect that with being 
in a space with your physical body and trying to 

understand that mentally condon said
is is condons nal semester at msu 
ough shes planning to take a break from 
school for a few years she eventually wants to 
tackle grad school with the hopes of one day 

becoming a professor of painting or printmak
ing
i want to live a life where i can make my 
work but also educate others and inuence 
other peoples lives positively condon said
oh wind will be in the 
exit gallery un
til friday feb 5 an artist reception is being 

held on ursday jan 21 from 5630 pm

must guide them to ensure their livelihood and 
your powers reclamation and to solve the mys
tery of the darkness 
you will also face a myriad of 
unexpected challenges along the way
ea e awakening is best described 
as an amalgam of settlers of catan magic 

e gathering and a classic topdown role 

playing game while ea does take some 

eort to learn since the mechanics of the game 

are unique the indepth storytelling stunning 

artwork and interactive plot make it more than 

worth the learning curve ere is plenty to do 

especially for an indie game and every quest line 

has a multitude of options some of which need 

to be unlocked by specic skills 
in the beginning you chose which god you will 
act as many need to be unlocked aer play
throughs aer that you meet your village 
you 
can cra food armor weapons buildings and 
more more excitingly new members of your tribe 
 even from other races  can be acquired in 
many dierent ways 
each child that comes of age 
will also be assigned a profession worker cras

man warrior and occasionally medic oh and 
everything from village to person is nameable
in order to gather resources explore the land 
defeat enemies and complete goals you send 
groups of your tribe on expeditions with food 
and wood rations to keep them alive on their 
journeys it is important to balance the skills of 
your parties since some challenges rely on classic 
ghting but many others may focus on social 
magical stealth and hunting skills among others
many of the creatures you meet on your quests 
are familiar but some may be entirely new orcs 

and elves paint a classic rpg picture but the 
personalities each dierent encounter contains 
makes them feel fresh strigas bugays leshys 
pineconettes and cmuch may be familiar to those 
wellacquainted with slavic mythology but arent 
oen seen in video game lore 
between the plethora of characters and the sheer 
amount of encounters and side quests ea 
is certainly worth replaying again and again in 
roughly 30 hours of play ive only encountered 14 
percent of the games events e diculty number 
of enemies and size of world are all highly custom
izable making each game wildly dierent from the 

beginning  even if your choices are the same 
for 1999 on steam ea e awakening 
is insanely replayable and therefore a great on
thebudget choice for college gamers available 
unfortunately only on pc ea is certainly 
worth learning more about investigate yourself 

by checking out the title on steam or visit devel

teaming up to raise money for

takes spare change donations to

central asia all proceeds go to 

cai lockhorn will exchange 

donations for a pint of cider and is 

matching donations up to 1000 

e program has raised over 7 mil
lion as their website says a penny 

in the united states may have little 

worth but in afghanistan pakistan 

and tajikistan just a few pennies 

can buy a pencil and open the door 

to literacy
e fundraiser also is matched 
with a photographic exhibition 

photographer 
erik petersen has 
worked with cai for four years 

and is drawn to the people who he 

called unique and beautiful e 

shots ranged from mountain vistas 

to kids playing soccer in a dusty 

eld but most were portraits  

beautiful young women in bleak 

surroundings ey are the focus 

and the mission of cai ose 

young girls are the future of their 

homes and by educating them 

cai hopes to expand their minds 

to the world as communications 

director hannah white pointed 
out if you get kids involved from 

the beginning the eects will be 

felt globally
however some may know 
cai only by tabloidworthy news 

coverage in 2011 cofounder greg 

mortenson was accused of fabrica
tion and fraud by jon krakauer a 

journalist and former supporter of 

cai e controversy that ensued 

became a polarizing national story 

in the end several things became 

clear  the account in mortensons 

book ree cups of tea was 

chronologically inaccurate and 

there had been nancial misman
agement at cai e attorney 

general concluded there was no 

criminal intent but did note sig
nicant lapses in judgement and 

mismanagement of funds morten
son paid cai just over 1 million 

in restitution as for the story 
inaccuracies mortenson has stated 

that the account actually took place 

over a period of a year and half 

rather than one trip but says that 

it was literary license to write it 

as he and his coauthor did in the 

end very little is completely clear 

 many including mortensons k2 

partner scott darsney defend his 

claims and mission others such as 

krakauer fervently deny his trust
worthiness e issue still simmers
nevertheless the institutes work 
continues ey continue to hold 

fund drives run pennies for peace 

and interact with donors around 

the world ey want to create what 

white calls a ripple eect ese 

communities need help but they 

really do want to have access to 

better educations and opportuni

ties she said it can be hard for 

many americans to understand that 
desire we are given our educations 

and we complain bitterly about 

them  the books the homework 

the long walk across campus peters

en recalls a girl who would rise at 

430 am to tend to animals make 

her family breakfast and walk two 

miles to school aer ve hours in a 

dirtoored concrete schoolhouse 

she would come back home to help 

with all the evening tasks perhaps 

in the end cafeteria dorm food and 

spreadout campus arent so terrible
of all the photos at the exhibi
tion there was one that stood 

out it is a girl standing before a 

blackboard in a white head scarf 

and robe in her hands she holds 

a book of bright blue cloth and 

she is smiling simply for the joy of 

being in school and that for the 

employees and supporters of cai 

is validation enough

my childhood and the cold war
by ka
ycee
 cronk
goosebumpssurely you remember rl stines 
prolic goosebumps series 
even if you 
somehow escaped childhood without read
ing one of his kooky horror novels you 
probably noticed their existence e seem
ingly endless supply of brightlycolored cov
ers boasting titles as amazing as say cheese 

and die and planet of the lawn gnomes 

stood out amongst the otherwisetepid fare 

of elementary school libraries everywhere 

ey were the most wholesome scary thing 

a kid could get their hands on and given 
how slim each novel was they could be 
devoured by the dozen
e goosebumps movie oers a fun trip 
down memory lane but instead of adapt
ing the novels themselves goosebumps 

takes their zany spirit and translates it to the 

screen it follows the tale of a teen named 
zach who moves in next door to the goose
bumps author himself rl stine played 
with relish by jack black and accidentally 

releases all of the monstrous creatures stine 

has ever created is is a scary movie made 

for kids so in other words its not very 

scary but for anyone looking for an exciting 

bit of nostalgia goosebumps is an excel
lent place to nd it
 bridge of spies
bridge of spies is spielbergs lat
est and once again the director doesnt 
disappoint delivering a harrowing tale that 
blends legal drama with espionage war and 
emotional upheaval based on a true story 

bridge of spies follows james b donovan 
tom hanks an insurance lawyer tasked 
with defending a soviet spy at the height of 

the cold war but aer an american spy 
plane is shot down and its pilot taken captive 
donovan is sent to 
east berlin to negotiate a 
prisoner exchange with the soviets with the 

goal of trading one spy for another
bridge of spies is polished bleak and 
somehow incredibly violent while also 
remaining nearly bloodless it is also  above 
all  very tense lives are constantly at risk 

throughout the course of the lm and this 
sense of danger is conveyed with missed 
meetings and stolen jackets as oen as it is 

with gunre and downed planes masterfully 
craed and breathlessly paced bridge of 
spies depicts a pivotal moment in the his

tory of the united states with all the smooth 
condence of a spy under re
the peanuts movie
more nostalgia miraculously the 
studio behind the e peanuts movie 
managed to take the minimalistic artistry of 
the classic cartoon and adapt the style into 
computergenerated animation without 
ruining it ey also succeeded in capturing 

the unique woebegone spirit of those old 
comic strips much to the delight of dedi
cated fans around the globe
so whats the gang up to this time well 
snoopy is on a quest to vanquish the red 

baron and everyones favorite sadsack 
charlie brown is determined to nally win 
over the aections of the little redhaired 

girl meanwhile lucy is still doling out 

psychiatric advice linus remains a pint
sized philosopher and that football is still 
impossible to kick basically e peanuts 

movie plays out in the same manner as 
the old holiday specials  imagine seeing a 
bunch of comic strips strung together jump
ing from story to story while maintaining 
the loosest of overarching narratives  and 
its all the better for it anyone who grew up 

watching its the great pumpkin charlie 
brown or a charlie brown christmas 
will nd something to enjoy in e peanuts 

movie and even new fans will nd them
selves chuckling at the antics of this iconic

aer a semester of operation the miller 
dining hall renovation has passed the test 
of bringing students a new modernized 

oncampus dining experience for those 

accustomed to the old miller many changes 

from the renovation are immediately obvi

ous included in these visible changes are an 

increased variety of food options and a larger 

seating area with a more diverse selection 

including couches and sheer aesthetic appeal 

beneath the surface however the miller 

renovation has changed much more than just 

the dining experience it has also changed its 

environmental impact through reduced food 

waste
a study completed by a group of research
ers from msu with help from faculty sta 

and students has found that the postreno
vation miller dining hall has reduced food 

waste by over 50 percent
leading the study were carmen byker 
shanks and selena ahmed assistant profes

sors in the msu college of educations 

department of health and human develop
ment and directors of the food and health 

lab along with alicia leitch a graduate 

student in health and human develop
ment with help from sustainable food and 

bioenergy and food and nutrition courses 

and students and sta from msus depart
ment of health and human development in 

a period of three days prior to the renovation 

the team found that miller produced 5132 

pounds of food waste in another three day 

period aer the renovation the food waste 
had dropped to 2707 pounds in addition 

preconsumer food waste or food that is not 

served to customers is now entering a com
posting system instead of going to a landll
e reduction in food waste was not an 
accident the study team along with miller 

planning sta brainstormed a list of ways to 

reduce the waste before and during the reno
vation according to byker shanks included 

in this list of proposals were using smaller 

serving utensils serving smaller portion sizes 

using smaller pans of food on the buet and 

creating signs that state the amount of food 

that is wasted e study team also hypoth
esized that other factors in miller inuence 

the reduction in food waste including 

changes in the food preparation processes 

aesthetics and appearance of the dining hall 

and consumer expectations
on sept 16 2015 the us agricultural 
secretary and the environmental agency 

deputy administrator revealed the rst 

nationwide national food waste reduction 

goal is food waste challenge launched by 

the united states department of agriculture 

usda and environmental protection 

agency epa calls for a 50 percent reduc

tion of national food waste by 2030 accord
ing to the usda website the us wastes ap
proximately 31 percent or about 133 billion 

pounds per year of the overall food supply 

available to retailers and consumers 
some major concerns of the usda 
and the food and drug administration 

fda along with those who conducted 

the miller food waste study at msu include 

the impacts of food waste on society and the 
environment according to byker shanks 

individuals with limited access to food have 

no opportunity to obtain it and waste only 

increases this problem when producing and 

distributing food natural resources are used 

in the process when food is wasted so are 

the natural resources so cutting down on 

food waste cuts down on emissions food 

waste is also the biggest contributor to land
lls and is a large contributor to methane gas 

production
with the work at miller dining hall 
msu is on the front edge of the national 

urgency to reduce food waste according 

to the msu campus planning design  

construction webpage preparations and 

site selection for a new dining hall are taking 

place e new dining hall will eventually 
replace the harrison and hannon dining 

halls leaving another opportunity to reduce 

food waste on campus
food waste reduction at miller din
ing hall can be considered a victory not 

only environmentally but also in terms 

of interdisciplinary success involved in 

the study design and implementations of 

food waste reduction strategies include the 

research team of byker shanks ahmed and 

leitch msus department of health and 

human development food and health 

lab sustainable food systems program

ability facilities services msu extension

ing that state agencies and their

phd candidate discusses mathematical 
model of gene transcription
by lilly brogger
tamra heberling a doctoral candi
date from the department of math
ematical sciences presented her lecture 
they transcribe with a little help 
from their friends a mechanistic 
model for cooperative behavior of 

rna polymerases on monday jan 25 

in the procrastinator theatre heber
lings research focuses on mathematical 
models of gene transcription
 along with a research 
team heberling has been 
studying how dna is 

transcribed and why it 

seems to be transcribed 

faster when there are 
more rna polymerases 
rnaps the team fo
cused on e coli bacte
ria which is commonly 

studied because of the fast 

rate at which it doubles 
allowing researchers to get 
a large amount of informa
tion from it  
transcription is a step in the process 
by which amino acids are formed an 

rnap initiates onto the dna strand 

it then produces a complementary rna 
strand in a process called elongation it 
then gets off the dna strand and releas

es the rna a ribosome then reads the 

messenger rna and produces an amino 
acid which is where proteins come 
from when the rnap moves down 

the strand of dna it often experiences 
short pauses when this happens the 
rnap can get backed up much like cars 

on a road
heberlings research is based off 
previous research on transcription she 

summarized the results of the first piece 
of research if you have more rnaps 
close together they not only all tran
scribe faster but individually go faster 
she continued thats what i mean 

by they transcribe with a little help 
from their friends theyre all working 
together in this group effort
one explanation this previous re
search pointed to was that one rnap 

could push another paused rnap 

forward the piece this research was 
missing was why this happened more 

research came out studying how coiling 

in strands of dna affect how rnaps 

travel across the strand and transcribe 
this research focused on single molecule 
transcription the question heberling 
wants to answer is why transcription 
happens faster with multiple rnap to 

do this she and her team combined the 

ideas from the previous research and set 

out to create a model that can explain 
this phenomenon our idea was lets 
take this single molecule 

data and information and 
really put it into what 

happens with many mol
ecules heberling said
they built the idea of 
torque into a mathemati

cal model simulating 
transcription with and 
without torque and 

found that torque causes 

shorter pauses between 
rnaps the team now 
proposes that torque 

is the mechanism that 
causes cooperation between rnaps 
this prevents collisions and makes the 
process go faster heberling and her 

team are now looking for experts in 
biology to collect more data so they can 
finetune their model
the lecture was part of the kopriva 
science seminar series  heberling was 
also chosen to be a part of the kopriva 
graduate student fellowship program 

both are funded through endowments 
created by msu microbiology gradu
ate phil kopriva who died in 2002 
heberling received her undergraduate 

degree from northeastern university 
in boston and has been at msu both 
for her masters and phd which she is 
close to completing
lisa davis from the department 
of mathematical sciences shared her 
enthusiasm for heberlings work at 

msu saying were very proud of her 
her activities in the department have 
been exemplary shes a very energetic 
student for more information on the

onmsus queer straight alliance fights for equality
spring semester has brought about a 
flurry of activity in bozeman from 
officially choosing the location of the next 

dining hall to gov bullocks executive 

order to msu losing the top carnegie 

classification there has been no 

shortage of news another topic 

that recently made headlines was 

the letter of demands that msus 

queer straight alliance qsa 

sent to president waded cruzado 

and her administration 
one of cruzados catchphrases 
typically directed to incoming 

students is welcome to montana 

state university welcome to your 

university her speech then discusses how 

each and every student has the ability to 

make the most of their experience at msu 

shape their future and gain an education 

and cruzado is absolutely right is is our 

university our tuition dollars go towards 

supporting an array of programs and depart
ments from asmsu to construction 
it only seems fair that we as the students 
of msu have the right to expect certain 

things from our school after qsa sent 

the letter of demands to cruzado and 

company it feels necessary to assess the 
struggle of our fellow students 

and acknowledge that we could 

be better serving the lgbtqia 

population 
in a random survey of students 
conducted by msus diversity 

awareness office 53 percent of 

lesbian gay bisexual queer and 

transsexual students felt they 

had to conceal their identity to 

avoid harassment and discrimi
nation thirtytwo percent of partici

pants reported instances of harassment in 

classrooms most students can attest that 

college is stressful and challenging lg
btqia students face more challenges that 

the average student and these problems are 

compounded by hateful speech microag
gressions and inadequate resources 
in light of qsas letter and the results of the 
survey it begs the question of how supportive 

and accepting msu actually is are we merely 

tolerating our fellow stu
dents or are we welcoming 

them into our commu
nity with friendship and 

acceptance as we should 

are we making sure that our 

lgbtqia students have 

access to the resources they 

need to succeed at msu 

discrimination is still very 

much a problem on college 

campuses and msu is 

no exception all msu 

students deserve to at the 

very least have reasonable 

services available to aid in their success  
e administration is working with qsa 
representatives to further discuss demands 

on wednesday jan 27 qsa met with dean 

of students matt caires vice president for 

student success chris kearns diversity 
awareness oce manager ariel donohue 

and vice president for finance and admin
istration terry leist on the student side we 
can continue to support our 

lgbtqia peers through 

language and actions such 

as not assuming pronouns 

refraining from slurs and 

most importantly treating 

fellow students with respect
understanding equality 
acceptance and under
standing in the context of 

our lgbtqia peers can 

be hard for some students 

these topics can also be 

increasingly difficult to 

understand if you belong 
to majority groups such as heterosexual 

white and male interested students are 

encouraged are to join qsa meetings 

which take place mondays at 700 pm or 

contact 
qsamsubozemangmailcom

alternative medicine
a story that describes my alternative 
medicine upbringing a family friend 
traveling through the livingston pass 
stepped out of his car on an excep
tionally windy day he was hit in the 

head by a metal sign and rushed to 

the hospital where he denied treat
ment wanting a second opinion from a 

professional the physician called this 

professional and was shocked to find 

the advice was given by a rural mon
tanan farmer self taught in alternative 

medicine this farmer was my father 
for many people living an alterna
tive medicine lifestyle is due to their 

upbringing for others the choice to use 
alternative or complementary therapies 
a combination of alternative and tradi

tional medicine is a decision of life or 

death james rhio oconnor had to 

make this choice after he was diagnosed 
with pleural mesothelioma a cancer 
that affects the inner membrane of cells 

lining the lungs and chest wall after 

exposure to asbestos this rare cancer 

takes decades to display symptoms but 
is typically fatal within one year 
there is no cure for this type of 
cancer but treatments such as chemo
therapy radiation therapy and surgery 
help to manage the disease these 
treatments often painful and expensive 

were not options for oconnor left 
with no other choice the doctor recom
mended oconnor end his days in the 
comfort of hospice 
against the doctors recommenda
tion oconnor began alternative treat
ments and retained an optimistic mind 

and powerful determination allowing 

him to live for 7  more years without 

his personal choice oconnor would 
never have outlived his prognosis 
there are countless forms of alter
native therapies some as simple as 
balanced diet or supplement regiments 

recently many practices such as yoga 
massage and hypnosis have become 
popular none of these techniques are 

approved by the fda since the results 

of such treatments are anecdotal re
gardless medical facilities now recom
mend the use of alternative therapies 

combined with traditional therapies 

allowing for another form of treatment  

complementary medicine designed to 

fit the patients lifestyle 
this is the direction cancer therapy 
should take personalized complemen
tary treatment for maximum recov
ery directed by the patient and their 
personal beliefs oconnor believed in 

something greater than himself his 

firm beliefs and positive mindset al
lowed oconnor to make it through his 

difficult recovery 
although alternative therapies are 
not a guaranteed treatment to an ail
ment they represent something else a 
personal choice after receiving a nega
tive prognosis patients feel like they 
have no control sometimes the answer 

to regaining hope and the positive 
mindset necessary for recovery is simply 
having a personal decision regarding the 

direction of treatment whether tradi

tional complementary or alternative  
many cancer survivors like james 
oconnor are sharing their stories 

of survival with the hope of inspiring 

those with similar diseases although 

each story involves different treatments 

some traditional some alternative one 
aspect stays the same each survivor was 
given a choice control of their life and 

hope

bozeman barely passes on lgbt equality
according to the human rights 
campaign hrc lgbt 
equality index bozeman scored 
72 out of 100 in 2015 bozeman 

is just getting by when it comes 
to making lgbt individuals feel 
at home while many places do 

worse than get by when it comes 

to lgbt rights boze
man still needs to work 

toward not only getting 
a better hrc lgbt 
equality index score but 

also providing a com
munity that accepts all of 

its people even outside 

of the ve categories the 

hrc grades
e ve categories the hrc fo
cuses on are nondiscrimination 

laws municipality as employer 

municipal services law enforce
ment and relationship with the 
lgbt community e city of 
bozeman has nondiscrimination 

laws that cover housing employ
ment and public accommodations 

essentially providing that discrimi
nation based on sexual orientation 
or gender identity is prohibited
municipality as employer 
ensures protection from dis

crimination for lgbt employees 
bozeman came in a bit below par 
while the city does have nondis

crimination in city employment 

and a city contractor nondiscrim
ination ordinance bozeman has 
yet to enact transgenderinclusive 
healthcare benets 
municipal services that serve 
lgbt constituents are a sad aair 
bozeman does not have a human 
rights commission lgbt liaison 

in the mayors oce nor anti

bullying school policies however 
bozeman does have an enforcement 
mechanism in the hrc provides 

services to lgbt youth homeless 

and elderly and provides services 
for persons living with hivaids 
according to the hrc law 
enforcement should include re
sponsible reporting of hate crimes 
and engaging with the lgbt 

community respectfully bozeman 
did report the 2013 hate crimes 
statistics but there is no lgbt 

police representation 
e last category relationship 
with the lgbt community 
measures the city leaderships 

commitment to fully include 

the lgbt community and to 
advocate for full equality in 
2015 bozemans leadership had a 
positive public position on lgbt 
equality and made 
proequality eorts in 
spite of restrictive state 
laws  bozeman also has 

openly lgbt elected 

and appointed munici

pal leaders
e hrc lgbt 
equality index doesnt 

however take into ac
count community feelings about 

lgbt individuals and has a 

problematic history with trans

inclusivity tyler kelly a com
munity member sheds light on 

this ive found accepting people 

here but do not consider boze
man as a whole very welcoming 

and accepting  is is echoed 

in the thoughts of many other 

community members and msu 

students such as michel tallichet 

he expands ere is still a lot of 

homophobia it is oen uncom
fortable or dangerous to be openly 

aectionate with a partner in boz
eman  carson oetting a junior 
at msu feels similarly i feel that 

 both msu and bozeman are 

overall lgbtphobic bozeman 

especially in comparison to many 

montana towns has a progressive 

legal attitude but the community 

attitude is frequently unfriendly 

or openly hostile 
ese comments illustrate the 
issue inherent in the hrc rating 

system identifying as lgbt may 

have some legal protections and 

representations but that is not 

the only aspect that aects lgbt 

people community inclusion and 

acceptance is noticeably absent in 

the rating just as it is in boze
man providing a safe place for 

lgbt individuals does not simply 

include legal rights though that 

is extremely important it also 

includes the ability to express 

oneself in public and private 
areas without the fear of nega
tive actions by bozemans people 
which includes msu students and 
administration 
bozeman has made a ton of 
progress in 2015 in 2014 boze
man only scored a 58  a failing 

score e 14 point score jump in 
2015 suggests changing public and 
legal perceptions of the lgbt 

community heres hoping 2016 
sees as much or more progress

  7e good bad and uber
ever since montana senate bill 
396 passed in may uber has had 
the opportunity to open its doors in 
montana and to great anticipation 
  e service operates through an app 
that allows users to request rides 
from nearby uber drivers who act 

as independently contracted taxi 

drivers through the service 
uber is going to be a welcomed 
guest in bozeman because it will 
benet almost everyone involved 
at rst glance drivers get paid 

80 percent commission which is 

more than they would make at a 

taxi service taxi services in town will notice 

this competition and be forced to improve 
their own business to keep up consumers 
benet from the convenience of uber the 

ability to have options about which service 

to use and the competition creating a better 

experience for whichever service they choose 
on paper it is truly a triumph of capitalism
however uber does have a sketchy history 
with everything from hiring drivers with 
histories of reckless road behavior to threaten
ing journalists who question their practices it 

is fair to say they have skeletons tumbling out 
of the closet is makes it pretty clear why it 
was such a weighty decision to allow such a 
company to come to bozeman
e problem is that it is a necessary ser
vice in this town montana is cold the bar 

scene is hot buses are free but overcrowded 
at 2 am and taxis are not incredibly reli
able in town overall it will be 

benecial to this city to have 
this added service it is likely the 

amount of duis handed out in 
the winter will go down with an 
extra service like uber available 

to people which hopefully will 
make the population safer
people have to remember who 
they are giving money to when 
they use a service like this and 
acknowledge that the company does not 

have a clean record shopping at walmart 

is cheap and convenient but consumers are 
giving money to a store that tries to keep its 

employees from getting benets and inten
tionally undermines local businesses e fact 
that uber has fought so hard not to consider 

its drivers employees and the many lawsuits 
pertaining to its practices should be taken 
into account when you use this company it 
is good to have uber as an option but we 
should not pretend it is the beallendall 
of ride services because that might lead us 
down a dangerous track

as far as semesters go fall 2015 was 
pretty stirring most notably with 
the stepping down of the student body

negatives surrounding a semes

gone to tremendous lengths to 
improve the success of the uni
versity throughout the term 
here are a few examples from 

an eventful fall semester
a dangerous campus
ere has been an increase in bear 
encounters on campus over the past few 
semesters to alleviate fears and further 

strengthen enrollment and retention 

rates msu began oering sex education 

to the bear community ough student 

health services oered free condoms 
bears were oen unaware of their proper 
use studies have shown that nearly all 

sexual intercourse among wildlife goes 

unprotected with access to safesex 

resources it is believed that 

the bear community will 

gain a better understanding 

of how to prevent unwant
ed pregnancy thus drop
ping the number of bear 

births a decline in the bear

advisory committee fac of a professor 

from each of the three chosen disciplines e 

fac faculty serve both as a review board and 

as mentors just think of the three letters of 

recommendation the students will graduate 

with lee said youll have a person from 

each discipline who knows you really well  

e fac will give a report every semester on 

the students progress to the honors college 

academic advisor martha sellers e stu
dents will then be interviewed by the honors 

college advisory board dis is a thesis
 driven 
degree the fac and members of the advi
sory board conduct the thesis defenses and 
determine whether graduation requirements 

have been met
if i were a freshman lee said i would 
of course study music and denitely some cell 

biology and neuroscience courses and math
ematics  i had to make the choice between 

music or medicine ere wasnt the possibil
ity of combining the two  lees excitement 

about the program 

was palpable i think 

were seeing students 

coming that are 

interested in the le 

and the right brain 

that are artists and 

scientists that are en
gineers and mathema
ticians and musicians it ts the generation of 

students that we have very well
students must take texts and critics 
or honr 301 an upper division substitute 

for texts and critics    and  may  complete  

the  honors  college  degree    but  dis  is 
available  to  all students  because  we  know  

that  many  highly
  motivated  students  are  
not  in  the  honors college lee said e 

degree requires a high level of independent 

learning and motivation so there is a high bar 

for the program each student must maintain 

at least a 30 gpa and must meet multiple 

levels of review is is not for everybody 

lee pointed out is is for students who are 

self
 motivated and driven
dis is a stepping
  stone to graduate work 
is is a phenomenal degree toward gradu
ate school in elds that we do not have on 
our campus lee said 
but it is not a degree 

that youre going to en
ter the workforce with 

you may if somebody 

is looking for a person 

who can think incred
ibly  independently  

and  critically  have  
have  a  multidisciplinary  perspective  on  

problems thats  a  dis  graduate  theres  no  

question  about  that  but  the  program  is  

geared  more  to provide students with a path 

specically suited to a graduate program of 

their choice
e degree may seem hokey but the pre
vious iteration of dis created stellar students 

ryan archer  a  1998  dis  graduate  focused  

his  degree  on  natural  resource  and  land  

use management archer is now senior legal 

counsel for boeing i have come to appreci
ate that a dis degree may not be advisable 

for many students since it is non
 standard and 
does not t a prototypical profession driven 
program but that is the intent because it is 

designed for a select class of students who plan 

to obtain advanced 

degrees in elds 

such as law medi
cine or the sciences 

for these students 

the dis presents a 

fantastic opportu
nity
jennifer devoe 
is another graduate 

of the earlier dis 

program i was very 

fortunate to have 

the dis  credentials  and  experiences  to  help  

set  me  apart  from  the  rest  of  medical  

school applicants  i  also  had  the  benet  of  

working  closely  with  several  stellar  faculty  

who  had knowledge  and  familiarity  with  

my  work  my  dedication  to  learning  my  
life  goals  and  my personal character  i had 

several interviewers comment on the richness 

of my msu education and the great aspects 

of the dis program devoe received both a 

rhodes and a goldwater scholarship  is  now  

an  mdphd  and  associate  professor  at  

the  oregon  health  and  science university
barriers  between  disciplines  are  erod
ing to  propel  students  into  the  future  
msu  should continue 

to support programs 

like dis which serve as 

incubators for innova
tion that the rest of 

the campus can adopt 

when this degree was 

rst formatted lee said 

i think they were way 

ahead of their time i 

think now were precisely 

where we should be and 

i think a lot of people 

are going to be very 
interested to see what happens here dis is 

only accepting ve students this semester  

the application deadline is feb 29  but will 

begin taking on new students every semester 

beginning next year lee is ecstatic i like to

the mathematics or neurochemistry of music entertainment engineering or virtual reality it isnt immediately clear how a student at msu can move their

halfway through head coach 
brian fishs second season at times 
it still seems that his young squad 
is trying to nd their identity a 
weekend win against university 

of idaho on saturday jan 23 may 

prove to be just the spark the team 

needed e win capped o back

the cats demonstrated an innate 

ability to perform over this past 

week the mens basketball team 
hosted eastern washington and 
idaho coming o of the the tail 

of backtoback losses on the road 

the cats were aching for redemp
tion 
at feeling of losing especial
ly at northern colorado we felt 

like we were in that game we were 

in a good position on the road we 

just came up a little short every
body was just hungry this week 

ready to get better senior guard 
marcus colbert said about last 
weeks colorado loss is weeks 

win streak was sure to satisfy that 

appetite 
last ursday jan 21 the cats 
rst game home was a contest 

against a 98 eastern washington 

squad e eagles pose one of the 

most ecient oenses in the big 
sky conference making the cats 

ability to hold them to a 418 

percent shooting average all the 

more impressive e lead changed 

hands four times in the rst half 
neither team able to secure a solid

advantage up front even with 
the advantage the cats turned 

the ball over nine times and were 
minus2 in rebound margin in the 
rst half it wasnt until the second 

half that they were able to possess 
better and fought the leagues best

recently i previewed a new app coming 
to directly serve the bozeman ski culture 
an app called ski bozeman ski boze
man is ultimately a simple guidebook to 

backcountry skiing in southwest montana 

for your phone at rst i was pretty skepti

cal of the app like others i had criticism 

about using an app for skiing if you go 

into the backcountry you should know 

what youre doing and go with experienced 

people you shouldnt need an app to help 

you understand where to go en i got to 

use the app and realized how much it is 

more like a climbing guidebook than a min
iature guide in your phone despite having 

spent years skiing the backcountry around 

montana i found this app to be a helpful 

and benecial addition to what i bring in 

the backcountry
 ski bozeman is chock full of great fea
tures which make travel in the backcountry 
much simpler saving you time when plan
ning where you are going to go it covers ski 

tours in the absaroka beartooth bridger 

gallatin and madison ranges around 

bozeman within each ski tour a plethora 

of information is given e information 

includes an overview on the area the ava
lanche information statistics of elevation 

gain skiable vertical skied aspects distance 

of skin average snowfall avalanche terrain 

danger and skier trac how to get there 

with a link to google maps waypoint guid
ance linked to google earth photos a link 

to the most recent gnfac advisory report 

and an included detailed map colored by 

slope angle
for me much of the information isnt 
overly necessary as ive traveled and skied 

parts of most of the areas provided how
ever the app isnt redundant in the slightest 

bit because like most people i enjoy adven
ture and trying new areas and skiing new 

slopes is is where the map included is 
helpful and worth the app price itself ese 

slope angle maps can help users get an idea 

of where the safest skin track can go and 

reading the topography can help nd new 

lines to ski and slopes of those lines and 

the danger associated with it when not in 

airplane mode your phone will show your 

position on the map using gps technol
ogy within the phone most recently while 

skiing in hyalite a place full of overgrown 

trees and dicult to nd runs i was able to 

not get lost while nding a slope i had nev
er skied before ive even used the app up at 

bridger to scope a run i hadnt done before 

and it resulted in tasty powpow face shots 

and poaching someones line using the 

linked waypoints into google earth prior 

to going will save that area on the google 

earth app and using this even more terrain 

can get explored with less bushwhacking 

and more time going downhill
every single time ive gone out skiing this 
year ive used this app i dont ski too much 
because im an ice climber but when i go 

ive used this even if it is to simply reverse 

a mistake i made by leading my party in 

the wrong direction this app has been 

extremely helpful in minimizing time lost 

in the woods and increasing the time spent 

shredding if you are new to the bozeman 

area or just trying to get out to new areas 

using this app will denitely help ensure a 

better time
disclaimer i was a beta tester for the ski 
bozeman app and do know the app creator 

however being a cynical primarily anti

technology guy being a beta tester did not 

inuence my opinions of this app

montana state ski team faces uphill battle
by andrew waters
at rst glance skiing is simple go 
downhill however competitive ski

ing has many intricate qualities that 

make it unique first o both nordic 

better known as cross country and 

alpine downhill racing are scored 

together ey use a points system 

in which the skier tries to reach the 

highest point total for a rst place 

nish the winner receives 40 points 

for their team and the total decreases 

from then on en each teams top 

three nishers scores are combined 

together to calculate each team total
 nordic ski racing consists of a 
short distance race called freestyle 

with a distance of 5k for womens 

and 10k for mens a longer distance 

race is called classical which typically 

for women is a 10k and for men is a 

20k e msu mens nordic team 

is lead by sawyer kesselheim sr he 

leads the team this year with 3rd and 

4th place nishes in the 10k and two 

6th place nishes in classical races so 

far this season for the womens team 
cambria mcdermott took 4th in 

both the freestyle and classical at the 

utah invitational and 7th and 24th at 

the msu invitational
alpine skiing competitions consist 
of slalom and giant slalom which 

involve skiing between poles or gates 

e dierence between slalom and 

giant slalom is the distance between 

the gates in giant slalom the gates 

are further apart returners david 

neuhauser jr and garret driller 

so are both looking to build o last 

season while both have struggled 

so far in giant slalom they have been 

successful in slalom with neuhauser 

taking 5th and driller 6th at the utah 

invitational ey were consistent 

at the msu invite with neuhauser 

taking 3rd and driller 9th
both teams look to build from 
last years success making it to the 

national championships msu 

returns ten skiers from last years 7th 

place team looking to continue to 

be competitive the cats hope fresh
men morten bakke and jeery bell 

can immediately contribute in his 
rst collegiate race bakke impressed 

with a 7th place nish in slalom and 

12th in giant slalom for the womens 

nordic team they look to have anika 

miller jr and johanna taliharm 

fr to have impactful seasons both 

have proven capable with miller plac

ing 9th at the utah invite and 13th 

at msu invite and taliharm placing 

6th in utah and 15th at msu
even with these new additions 
the path to a national championship 

looks rugged with the university of 

denver and university of colorado 

both being stacked with experienced 

talent last year university of colo
rado won the national title and has 

been good so far this year with two 

second place nishes only losing by a 

combined total of 17 points not too 

far behind were the bobcats placing 

fourth at both events even though 

they have had some success ey 

wont be satised but theyre getting 

better every day and that is the key to 

a good season we just need to keep 

building toward ncaas msu

right now even though their music is what 

they want to do once they graduate while e 

bent bones do provide sound that is familiar to 

some their blend of funk and rock provides a 
nice change to a lot of the popular rock music 
of late a lot of the groups musical inuence 
comes from bands 

like incubus
on this upcom
ing album drivin 
to the rhythm they 
didnt do the entire

he has helped musi

cians like u2 chris
tina aguilera and whitney houston because 

of his previous experience he was able to use his

doc was a really cool experience hessian said 

hes worked with a bunch of bands in the past 

so he has seen a lot of the struggles weve had

work with him
rough wileys aid the bones were able to 
record the album in a whole new way where 
most bands record each part separately the 

new album recorded everything all at once 
our rst album was multitracked which 
means that everything was recorded sepa
rately gaglia said e way doc had us do 

which was recording live worked so much bet
ter rather than just listening to a track of the 

drums and playing along we were able to see 
how we were playing and feed o each other 
we were able to adapt to what everyone was 

doing it added a ton of energy to our sound 

and made us sound better e new musics 
energy is high adding to already great music

preview 
brian regan coming to brick breeden
by adam waldorf
growing up with a mother who didnt 
let me get away with anything the amount 
of things i could watch on tv was limited 

because of this i wasnt able to watch a lot of 

standup comedy which was upsetting to me 

because just like everybody i enjoy laughing 

ere was one comedian that i was allowed 

to watch that has transitioned well into my 

adult sense of humor brian regan because 

of this i was incredibly excited when i heard 

he was going to be performing in bozeman 

on jan 31
since his rst standup special regan has 
been known for his appropriate but eective 

observational comedy while his standup 

lacks cursing he still talks about adultrelated 

topics i hate it when people say that my 

comedy is clean regan told me when 

people say that my standup is clean it makes 

me sound like im going to be up on stage ty
ing balloon animals or something i still talk 

about adult topics like i might make a joke 

about signing a mortgage agreement or high 

cholesterol something that will completely 

go over a childs head it gives my comedy a 

dierent kind of edge than your traditional 

comedian
for those who have watched regans 
observational comedy before this upcoming 

show is going to be completely new material 

he said that he did a special for comedy 

central about three or four months ago and 

he will only be using about 20 percent of that 

material at most 
his material for the upcoming show will 
also be a bit dierent than audiences may 

be used to i usually talk about things i 

see in everyday life for the tour im do
ing right now im trying to spruce it up a 

bit from what i usually do ere will be 

dierent kinds of jokes this time regan 

said with the upcoming election there 
are so many more things i can make jokes 

about so my routine will make more jokes 

about the government ill be making jokes 

about foreign policy some jokes about local 

government and even some jokes about gun 

control which i feel may strike a bit closeto

home in montana with those they will be 

approached with kind of a new angle on the 

subjects something people havent heard be
fore  going to be a little bit of that material 

and a little bit of the stu my fans are used to 

its going to be a bit dierent from the norm 

but i still plan on talking about things that 

interest me
ere will be an opening act before regan 
performs e opener will start their 20 

minute routine around 7 pm with regan 

coming onstage aerwards 
so come down to the brick breeden 
fieldhouse on jan 31 to watch hilarity ensue 

as brian regan delivers topoftheline jokes

features slide guitar and a repeating 

sitar line overlaid with becks half

rapped angsty lyrics it was an un
expected hit which rocketed him 

to success soon aer he recorded 

mellow gold his rst studio 

album mellow gold developed 

becks sampling techniques and 

distinctive lyrical wit odelay 

followed mellow gold and 

further pushed the artist into the 

limelight his next studio album 

mutations was recorded in two 
weeks and featured little doctor
ing in sharp contrast to odelays 

cutandpasted sounds midnite 

vultures his next attempt was less 

commercially successful but still 
received a grammy nomination for 
best album 
sea change released in 2002 
marked a transition and a radical 

departure from the grungy heav
ily sampled sounds of odelay 

and mellow gold e album is 

dark simply lyrical and deals with 

themes of heartbreak and emotion 

his next three albums  guero 

e information and modern 

guilt  show further develop
ment of style guar and e in
formation are original and vibrant 

but still showcase becks repressed 

vocal style and easy lyricism 

modern guilt is more subtly 

made and reveals a newer quieter 

sound morning phase becks 

most recent album trends towards 

the spirit of sea change it is so 

introspective and delicately styled 

lyrically the album ranges through 

both the joyous and the tragic but 

is never depressing
odelay is unique to say the 
least  it utilizes many genres and 
you cannot listen once and hope to 
hear every nuance e tracks never 

have a clear or simple melody ey 

are sonic experiments formed of 

interweaving tapestries of sound 

which combine to form strangely 

compelling works hotwax is 

driven by a funky bass line and an 

oldschool rap feel and features 
heavy use of radio staticesque 
guitar work lord only knows is 

grungy electronic music reminis

cent of nirvana e new pollu
tion features a sleazy saxophone 

line jackass sounds like a 

bizarre folk tune and derelict is 

driven by a middle eastern drum 

line and sitarlike melody beck 
switches seamlessly from rapping 

to sounding like a folk artist to 

singing with heavily repressed 

vocals all the while he is helped 

along by the samples working be
hind him  everything from saxes 

and grungy static to organs bells 

and steel guitars
from its sampled opening ri 
odelay makes itself a presence to 

be reckoned with it runs the full 

range of becks power from ska

rap to bluesy folk it is at times 

a strange mixture however the 

album holds up when listened to as 

a cohesive whole from the grungy 

openings it descends to scratchy 

folk and then up to swinging elec
trojazz it is an auditory puzzle a 
strange and compelling piece of art 

that has not declined with age
odelay is still fascinating 20 
years later  in all that time there 

has been no work that has been 

so violently experimental and 
still so commercially successful 
e album is a testament to the 
power of innovation and creative 
experiments beck has evolved 

signicantly since 1996  he is 

no longer the king of slackers as 

the media dubbed him for all the 

change though he is still a unique 

and stylish artist with a sound to 

match

my signicant other used to hate eating 
veggies im fairly certain that their diet con
sists primarily of red bull microwavable bur
ritos chips and salsa and whatever i chose to 
cook some meals have instant appeal others 

have been viewed with suspicion in short 

im a pro at feeding vegetables to a person 

who viewed them with thinlyveiled disgust 

now my partner loves vegetables i imagine 

the following recipe will be successful in con
verting most any picky eaters whether theyre 

children or all grown up
ingredients
 brussels sprouts halved or quartered 
depending on size or cauliower cut with 
minimal stalks is recipe also works for 

asparagus broccoli and other similar veg
etables 
 cooking oil make sure it works well for 
high temperatures so the vegetables dont 

stick
 lemon juice i usually use the cheap 
lemonshaped bottles you nd in the fruit 

section of the grocery store fresh lemons 

will work if you want to be fancy
 salt i use a sea salt grinder ey arent 
very costly and taste better than table salt
 garlic salt e kind i use also has pars
ley in it but that is optional you can also 

use canned crushed garlic or garlic powder 

if you do use garlic instead of garlic salt you 

will need to add a bit more salt than the 

recipe species 
 cavenders all purpose greek seasoning 
is is my favorite allpurpose seasoning 

however any allpurpose seasoning you like 

should work ne
 a cookie sheet 
 spatula that can handle high heat 
e process for each recipe is fairly dif
ferent a big thing to keep in mind for both 

is to always season to taste try a brussels 

sprout from the sheet its a great way to test 

temperature texture and avor  especially 

since we all like slightly dierent things
directions
1 aer cutting and washing the vegeta
bles oil a cookie sheet 
2 en scatter the veggies evenly across 
the area 
3 preheat your oven to 350400 degrees 
i like to use high temperatures since it results 

in crispy vegetables for less crunchy ones 

you may want to lower the temperature and 

cook them for less time 
4 while your oven preheats season the 
vegetables with a quick small drizzle of oil a 

generous drizzle of lemon juice a couple even 

dustings of both garlic salt and cavenders 

and a quick grind of salt you want these to 

turn out a bit like chips or popcorn crisp 

salty and addictive without the boiled or 

mushy avors theyll be a bit more satisfy
ing to those among us that are veggieintol
erant in this recipe you can also feel free to 

add small bits of raw bacon or prosciutto to 

give it a more meaty avor cheese is also 

a great addition ive used crumbled blue 

cheese with brussels sprouts and shredded 

cheddar with cauliower many times 
5 check on the progress of the vegetables 
roughly every 15 minutes is will ensure 

that nothing burns when the edges are tan 

to brown theyre ready to eat
6 dust with cavenders garlic salt and salt 
to taste if you are using garlic rather than the 

garlic salt i recommend roughly a teaspoon 
either dish goes well with steak pork or 
chicken or can liven up a pasta meal happy 

eating and i hope nothing gets spit out

suicide prevention summit time to take action
by 
dakot
ah whiti
ngthe montana university system 
organized the first statewide summit 
on suicide prevention on monday jan 
1 local residents health and education 
professionals as well as students were in
vited to come together to learn and share 

about the ways our community can work 
together to prevent suicide
after the welcoming initiation the 
crowd split off into small workshop 
groups workshop number one included a 

group focused on social media and suicide 

prevention erin butts the statewide 

school for mental 
health coordinator 
for the montana 
office of public 
instruc
tion led the group butts created a safe 

and friendly environment where the group 

discussed current trends in social media 
suicide prevention and mental health in 
higher education we live in a society 
where technology isnt leaving we need 
to teach positive internet use to promote 
positive connections a student from mis
soula told the group at the end of the ses
sion butts told the group about a phone 

app that can be used as a resource for 
suicide prevention 
the app is called a 
friend asks and is sponsored by a suicide 

prevention group called the jason founda
tion a friend asks is a free app that 
shares information about what to say and 
do if someone you know or you yourself 
are struggling with thoughts of suicide 
this is a communitywide responsi
bility clinical director nance roy of 
the jed foundation told the group after 
reassembling roy highlighted that on 
average only 10 percent of enrolled stu
dents on college campuses use counseling 
centers and services 
in hopes to catch 
students who may be struggling she 

presented the idea of screening students 
for mental health when students go into 

college health centers roy emphasized 
that depression is not just a developmen
tal issue and that we cannot treat mental 
health as something that will simply pass 
over with time not every student needs 
psychiatric therapy roy spoke some
times having someone that reaches out is 
enough 
according to statistics presented by 
roy in the past year 51 percent of stu
dents report having overwhelming anxiety 
at some point in school 31 percent are so 
depressed that it is difficult to function 

and 75 percent report having serious 

thoughts of suicide with statistics like 

these roy said it is important for our 
community to recognize that students will 
not always communicate their distress 

why do we believe that a student who is 

feeling hopeless sad isolated and exhaust
ed will have the presence of mind to make 

a phone call to a stranger and lay bare his 

desolation 
one goal of the suicide prevention 
summit was the hope that our community 
will recognize our responsibility when 
it comes to mental health and that with 

montana having the highest suicide rates 

in the country according to the national 

vital statistics report it is important for 
our students to recognize that they are 
not alone lets reach out to the students 

that sit in the back of the classroom and 

recognize those students that are margin
alized or isolated roy said concluding 
with her speech 
the suicide prevention summit contin
ued for two days for more information 
their website and contact information can 

be found at

beginning this august university food 
services and campus planning design  
construction will break ground on a new 

dining hall that will serve the residents on 
the northeast side of campus
on tuesday jan 26 the university 
facilities planning board hosted an open 
forum to make a final decision on the 

site location proposal for the new dining 
hall 
originally the board selected eight 
potential locations scattered around the 

northeastern side of campus 
those eight 
locations were reduced to three just west 
of herrick 
hall between 
herrick and 
hannon directly north of the jake jabs 
school of business and entrepreneurship 
and directly north of the chemistry and 
biochemistry building cbb 
the open forum had a large turnout 
from community members and staff as

sociated with the child development 

center in 
herrick 
hall 
they asked that 
the new dining hall not be placed by 
her
rick because of possible dangers associ

ated with having large food trucks and 

increased traffic around the preschool

aged children 
other concerns were that 

the location to the north of jake jabs if 
selected would displace approximately 
60 parking spaces and the location next 

to the cbb would eliminate 40 parking 

spaces along with displacing the tempo
rary chemistry labs already in place at 

that location 
at the conclusion of the meeting the 
board decided to propose the location 

just north of the cbb to president waded 

cruzado 
the board cited its low cost of 
site development and ease of access for 

food trucks as support for their decision 
the board did recognize the inconve
nience of relocating the labs in the tem
porary lab units and wants to help find a 
new space for the labs if this location is 

approved
the new dining hall would be approxi
mately 30000 square feet with seating for 
about 700 students for those concerned 
about the potential for obstructed views 

of montana 
hall the design of the new 
dining hall would be flush with the cbb 

maintaining the aesthetics of the area 
although the walk to the new dining hall 
for the residents of 
hannon 
hall will be 
further than that of their current situa
tion the board stated that the walk would 
only be approximately two and a half min
utes from 
hannon which they felt was an 
acceptable distance
university food services expressed 
excitement about the new project and the 
ability to design a new space rather than 
working around preexisting building and 
design constraints 
todd jutila the direc
tor of university food services said that 

the organization has learned a lot from 

the miller renovation and will implement 
many of the same features in the new 

dining hall students can expect the same 
style of service where a majority of the 
food is cooked and produced out front 
not in the back room not only does this 
allow students to see their food being 
made but it also increases the capacity of 

the dining hall before renovation miller 
was making approximately 5000 meals 
a day post renovation that number has 
jumped up to 7000 according to jutila 
that number of meals would not have 
been possible with the old style of food 
preparation
jutila said that that he is pleased with 
the unique seating layout of miller 
including areas with couches and televi
sions twoperson raised tables fourper
son raised tables and the larger traditional 
style tables at the university facilities 
planning board meeting some ideas 

presented for the new dining hall seat
ing were a potential sky garden and green 

space in front of the building 
according to jutila because the new 
dining hall does not need to be built 
around preexisting infrastructure the 

entire process will be smoother than the 
miller renovation jutila explained that 
part of the reason ufs decided to con
struct a new building rather than renovate 

harrison and 
hannon was that older 
buildings limit the possibilities of the 

project and can have many setbacks 
he 
used the miller renovation as an example 

the team had to deal with unexpected in
frastructure complications as well as make 

updates to the seismic and plumbing sys
tems 
on top of the benefits of designing 
from the ground up the new building will 
not need phases and will not disrupt the 

services at 
harrison and 
hannon which 
will continue to run until the completion 

of the project
the new dining hall is expected to open

 5climbing wall expansion still in development
by l
illy br
ogger
bozeman is home to an avid 
climbing community which 
includes many msu students is 
excitement has been hard on the 
climbing wall in the marga 
hosaeus fitness center an estimated 
60 to 80 patrons use the climbing 
wall each day and 10 to 12 climbers 

per hour when the wall is busy e 
heavy usage is not new 
in 2011 a proposal was formulated to expand 
the climbing wall into the adjacent 
racquetball court
 e proposed expansion has 
come up against several obstacles 

but continues to nd support 
among msu students noah 

bosworth is an employee at the 
tness center and works at the 
climbing wall 
he is also a member 
of the vert
igo climbing club 
bosworth believes the number of 

people using the wall and student 

interest is justication for going 
through with the expansion we 
see it at the climbing gym every 

week 
id say every shi between 
ve and ten people ask me hey 
whats up with the expansion
funding and organization 
have been a major challenge e 
original plan no longer suces as 
cost and other factors have changed 
over the past ve years bosworth 
partially attributes the holdup to 

issues of organization a chronic 
issue with this expansion eort has 
been somebody gets interested in 

it somebody gets busy and then 
they graduate before they can make 
headway
kevin volkening an msu stu
dent killed in a climbing accident 

initiated the plan and started 

the vert
igo climbing club 
bosworth believes that expanding 

the wall in memoriam of volkening 

would be a worthy tribute to an 
important contributor to the msu 
climbing community and would be 

more justication for the expan
sion 
its not just a bunch of col
lege kids wanting a climbing gym 

its college kids wanting a climbing 
gym for a great purpose to pay 
tribute to a great individual
e tness center also hosts a 
yearly climbing competition and 

bosworth explained that the wall 

is barely able to accommodate 

e prince and princess of plastic 
climbing competition will be held 
on feb 20 this year and is open to 

everyone bosworth believes that 
with all of the interest in climbing 
in bozeman the competition has 

potential for growth 
i think a 

competition like that brings a lot of 
potential to the school
continuing with the expansion 
will require drawing new plans 
for the expansion which will be 

costly bosworth explained that 
he and others pushing for the ex
pansion are taking steps to move 
forward like getting asmsu 

involved and organizing meetings 

among those who can help them 
draw new plans

hall 
room numbers
by j
ohn 
trapp
wilson 
hall best described by depart
ment of english professor josef verbanac 
as a disservice to architecture everywhere 

where the excuse sorry 
i was late 
i could 

not find this classroom is all too common 
and there should be a sign on the stairwells 
to the second floor reading abandon all 

hope ye who enter here 
however it is not 
impossible to navigate nor is the floor plan 

and room numbering scheme without logic 

and reason if time is taken 

to thoroughly study it
because of the courtyard 
entrances the first floor 

can almost be considered 
two separate buildings 
one of these is larger and 
has a bend in it because 

of this it will be called 
the l side 
the other 
side will be called the 
i 
side as it is just a straight 

hallway 
the l side contains rooms 1100 
through 1132 and rooms 1153 through 
1163 the i side contains rooms 1333 
through 1151
the whole numbering scheme starts in 
the center of the l side with room 1100 
room 1100 is actually the hallway right 
at the bend the one with the elevator in it 

however the elevator is not in room 1100 

it is actually in its own room room 1163 
it continues on to the south with the bath
rooms being 1101 to 1103 
the hallway 
outside of the bathrooms is room 1118 
the area with tables and couches outside 
of the math 
testing center is 1158 with 
the entryway by the math learning center 

mlc being 1107 
the mlc itself is 
rooms 1111 1112 and 1113 naturally 

continuing north on the west side of the 

l side are rooms 1114 through 1122 

however it is important to note that room 
1120 is nowhere to be found room 107b 

is the stairwell that is in the corner near the 

elevator leading down 
the north wall of 
the l side the one where the refurbished 
classrooms are contains rooms 1123 

through 1132 with the exception being 
room 1127 which is the hallway
the i side of the building is surpris
ingly straightforward 
the rooms start in 
the northeast side with room 1133 and 
continue clockwise around the building 

and ending with room 1151 which is a 

bathroom rooms 1137 1140 1161 and 

1146 are hallwayscommon areas
the first floor numbers end with the 
south side of the l side 

with rooms 1153 to 1156 

rooms 1160 1162 and 

1163 are hallways and the 

earlier mentioned elevator
the second floor is much 
harder primarily because 

it contains mostly offices 

because offices are much 

smaller than classrooms 

having only two rows of 
rooms separated by one hallway is a waste of 

space 
instead the second floor of wilson 
has offices running along the sides with a 

third row running in the middle and two 

hallways unfortunately upgrades and re
models have left the whole floor confusing 

and much like a rats nest 
it has also divided 
the outer hallway making the inner hallway 

the only one in which one can walk all the 

way around 
it is important to remember 
this fact for navigating 
think of the inner 
hallway as a highway with occasional exits 

leading to a small section of the outer 

hallway 
the best explanation of the numbering 
scheme is to think of it as a u with room 

2100 right above 1100 from there it 

continues around the outside occasionally 

jumping to the middle to number the rooms 

there
if you have any other questions or if you 
are lost in wilson do not hesitate to ask 
someone for help and remember to leave 
plenty of time to find your classroom
think of the 
inner hallway 
as a highway 
with occasional 
exits leading to 
a small section of 
the outer hallway
msus carnegie classication 
receives a downgrade
by se
th
 ur
ickfollowing changes in the carnegie clas
sication system msu is no longer one 
of the 108 us universities to hold a very 
high research activity ruv
h rating 
msu still meets most requirements for 

the ruv
h rating but it would need to 
award more doctorates to receive the ru

vh classication in the future is change 
was announced on the rst day of classes by 

msu president waded cruzado in a letter 

written to the msu community 
is year the 
carnegie founda
tion turned over 

administration of 
the classication 
system to 
indiana 
universitys center 

for postsecondary 
research with 
this recent move 
some elements of 
the classication 

system have also 

been revised 
in its 
most recent dra 

reassessment of the 

classication the 

center has placed msu in the second of 
its threecategory doctoral classication 
 doctoral universities 
higher research 
activity r2 cruzado explained
in another letter written to msu 
faculty and sta cruzado said that while 

work still needs to be done with regard to 
the number of doctoral degrees msu is 
producing the institution still shows the 

necessary strength in six of of the seven 

areas used for classication purposes
cruzado noted that carnegie classica
tions do not confer nancial advantages 

to the institutions that receive them and 

said that the carnegie classication has 
been one of the recognitions we treasure 
at montana state university and it will 

continue to be that way as important 
as the carnegie classication is for us 
however it is important to remember we 

focus on excellence because that is what 
great universities do not because we chase 
designations
additionally the carnegie classica
tion has been an issue of major interest to 

msus faculty senate in past years cru
zado said while msu never pursued 

the categorization it has been gratifying 
and fair to be included in the highest tier 
our faculty sta and students have been 
justiably proud of the recognition
because of the importance of the clas
sication to the msu community the 
administration examined the reasoning 
behind msus declassication and the 
steps it would need to take to be re
classied
msu has had a strategic plan since 
2012 and we are sticking to that plan as 
we believe it has all the elements neces
sary to regain the carnegie classication 

msu executive director of university 
communications 

tracy ellig said
in the letter 
cruzado expressed 
a determination 
to continue to 

follow msus 

strategic plan set 
forth by the plan
ning council she 

said that msu 
will continue to 

focus on its core 

strengths of agri
culture science 
engineering and 

nursing and would 
also continue investing in arts humani
ties business education and social sci
ences in order to broaden the universitys 

strengths she added that the administra
tion was committed to doubling research 

expenditures during the next decade
she also praised the work of renee 
reijo pera msus vice president for 

research and economic development to
wards championing research at msu and 

pointed to the rise of total grants awarded 
in the last scal year 21 percent and 
the increase in total dollars awarded 26 

percent concluding that peras work will 

continue to help advance msus research 
enterprise
cruzado said in conclusion 
our 
shared goals in regards to the carnegie 

classication along with our passion 
for our landgrant mission will inspire 

us together to continue to excel paired 
with other accomplishments  increased 
enrollment at all levels increased quality 

of incoming classes the best retention and 
graduation rates in the state record num
ber of construction projects and increased 
donor giving  
i know enhancing the rec

ognition of our research is something we 
can accomplish sooner rather than later
as important as the 
carnegie classication 
is for us however it is 
important to remember 
we focus on excellence 
because that is what 
great universities do 
not because we chase 
designations

7msu and m
it
 professors meet to discuss science and god
by se
th
 ur
ickdue to the success of the 
christianity and the 
tooth 
fairy dialogue held in april 2015 
the veritas forum returned to msu 
on jan 26 with 
our place in the 
universe 
the dialogue was held 
between an agnostic philosopher 
and a christian scientist in order 
to compare and contrast their 
differing worldviews due to the 
large attendance at the last event 

the dialogue was held in the sub 
ballrooms most of the seating was 

occupied
the event was moderated by msu 
philosophy professor gregg valeriano and 
featured 
ian hutchinson an author and 
professor of nuclear physics at m
it
 and 
david max maxfield an adjunct profes
sor of philosophy at msu 
hutchinson 
and maxfield took the stances of chris
tian and agnostic respectively
following a brief introduction in 
which the audience was assured that 
tonights event is not a debate the 
participants were introduced
the dialogue began with each par
ticipant having 15 minutes to state their 
point and worldview with 
hutchinson 
going first
in his opening statement 
hutchinson 
iterated that traditional education is not 

antireligious but is in fact christian 

in origin quoting francis bacon in that 
the purpose of education is the relief of 
mans estate and that it is very christian 

in nature
he argued that christianity doesnt 
call for blind faith it calls us to intel
ligent faith and that his beliefs are 

evidence based but not upon evidence 

that can be examined by science
maxfield began his statement with 
an impromptu poll of the audience to 
determine their beliefs 
he encouraged 
them to question their beliefs saying 
if 
you dont change your mind at least once 
on something big in college then we 
the faculty failed you 
he challenged 
the perceived assertion of monotheistic 
religions that humanity is significant in a 

cosmic sense saying that while possible 
it was not probable or logical
following their opening statements 
maxfield and 
hutchinson addressed each 
others points covering topics including 

whether christianity was humancentric 
the reasons why christianitys stance on 

various scientific findings has changed 

over time and just what constitutes evi

dence of gods existence
when challenged to consider what 
may be the strongest evidence against 

gods existence 
hutchinson replied 
that he felt it was the existence of evil 

and pain and that the christian faith 
recognizes the reality of suffering in its 
teachings
at this point the floor was open to ques
tions from the audience including when 
will science and faith become incompat
ible does your worldview allow for 

ultimate moral truth where do you 

stand concerning christian sects whose 
views cannot be reconciled with science 
and what is accomplished by three white 

men up on the stage arguing about the 

existence of god all of the questions 

were discussed at length by maxfield and 

hutchinson
valeriano concluded the night by asking 
maxfield and 
hutchinson the question 
what kind of evidence would cause you 

to change your mind
hutchinson answered that it would 
require convincing evidence that the resur
rection of jesus christ had not taken place 

while maxfield replied that based on his 
knowledge and past experiences it would 
be hard to imagine such an experience
the event then concluded with the 
invitation to gather at the union market 

afterwards for refreshments and further 

discussion
if you dont change your mind at least once on something 
big in college then we the faculty failed you

   bcbsmtcom  i  18004477828last week the bozeman chronicle 
published an article titled queer 
students say msu campus intolerant 
which was in response to a list of demands 
set forth by queerstraight alliance 

these demands included gender neutral 
bathrooms and locker rooms as well as 
roommate screening 
this 
received some extreme backlash 

in the comments section from 

former university seminar 

101 instructor 
kevin 
kervick 
kervick taught us 101 last 
semester and is not currently 

employed at msu  
according to their website 
the purpose of university semi

nar includes creating a learning environ
ment which promotes vibrant interac

tions between firstyear students and a 
faculty member being that these courses 
are geared towards creating supportive and 

fruitful relationships between the students 

and the instructor it is inappropriate that 

kervick  a us 101 instructor   should 
make such comments in a public forum 
us 101 emphasizes understanding in a 
supportive and truly collegiate manner 

kervick did the opposite when he made 
hateful comments in a public forum that 
he knew would be read by msu students 
kervicks comments contribute to the 
constant discrimination that lgb
tq 
students already face and in a much more 
personal sense as a former teacher 
kervick claimed that 
the one group 
being victimized by this nonsense are het
erosexual white males 
this is an obvious 
fallacy from the getgo because his straw 
man argument an argument that tries to 
refute an argument by refuting something 
the arguer did not even present should at 
least include the gays victimizing straight 
women as well 
kervick is giving a reactionary response 
to something that he feels is threatening 
his way of life even though all it is trying 
to do is allow people of different lifestyles 
to be given the same freedoms he enjoys 
on a regular basis and freedoms 
which in no way hinder him from 
doing so 
he goes on to say claims 
of discrimination against lgb
tq 
students are hoaxes for cash and 

status even as a straight white 
male 
i know 
i would be lying 

to myself if 
i tried to say that 
was true 
i have personally seen 
discrimination against queer stu
dents misogyny and racism on campus so 

it is not true that many of these perceived 
transgressions are imagined or created 
to achieve political goals or that msus 
campus is the wonderful place of inclu
sion and freedom to be whomever one 

wants to be that he claims it is 
or maybe 
it is for people like me and him because 

i have personally never experienced any 
discrimination against myself here
he goes on to cite an article from the 
rightwing equivalent to the 
huffington 
post to help prove his point but on exami

nation it does not seem to have much if 

anything at all to do with what he was say
ing 
it does have a link to an article about 
the best hate crime hoaxes of 2015 and if 

that is not a straw man trying to defend 

the idea that nothing needs to be done 
about hate crimes then 
i do not know 
what is 
he also links to a jonathan 
haidt 
speech on strengthening vs coddling 

haidts argument is that liberals just want 
to protect everyone in society and make 
everyone friendly but by doing this people 
become weaker 
he claims that that people 
should be able to do whatever they want 

and that will lead to the same peaceful so
ciety that liberals strive for but if history 

shows anything that is not the case
unfortunately hate crimes are dealt 
with is because they do happen 
it would 
be hard to argue against the matthew 

shepard act a piece of legislation put into 

place to protect the lgb
tq community 
from hate crimes after matthew shepard 

was beaten and left for dead for being a 

homosexual 
the only good argument is 
that you believe that people should be 

allowed to do whatever they want includ
ing impeding on the freedoms of others 

through discrimination and violence 
ker
vick claims that 
these millennial kids 
have been raised well to have tolerance 
or even indifference 
then why do hate 
crimes against the lgb
tq community 
still exist 
in that case 
kervick is blam
ing the previous generation for bigotry 
when it is clear that discrimination is not 
generational 
maybe 
kervicks arguments would be 
sound if the problem of discrimination 

did not exist on this campus but it does 
whether you like it or not 
if you do not 
like the fact that organizations like qsa 
exist to protect students on campus then 
you should be focusing your efforts on 
helping groups like qsa who want to 
end it or by strengthening the diversity 
awareness 
office or the msu voice cen

over burning urine 
fires up changesonline dating app 
tinder has under
gone a major facelift through recent 
updates joining forces with 
healthvana 
a patientengagement platform for health 
clinics 
tinder now sports an 
interface that allows its users 
to locate health facilities that 
test for sexually 
transmitted 
infections s
ti
s these are the 
first dating app changes of their 

kind to occur in response to the 

strong association between an 
increase in the spread of s
ti
s 
and an increase in the use of dat
ing apps 
more important than the change of 
tinders interface is the cultural changes 
these updates signify society has adapted 
intercourse into a level of convenience 
requiring a mere tap of the screen of a 
cell phone with no regard for potential 
repercussions 
one would think a grown 
adult frequenting a university 
college or other form of higher 
education establishment would 
consider their health enough 
to inquire into the health of 
another prior to engaging that 
person sexually 
however stud
ies from the centers for disease 

control and prevention suggest 

otherwise as roughly half of the 
tens of millions of new annual s
ti
 cases 
within the united states occur in those 

aged 1524
while some may blame a lack of sexual 
education organizations like the a
ids 
healthcare foundation claim 
tinder 
is at fault for rising s
ti
 rates 
though 
tinder may successfully allow someone 
to objectify individuals in set radii from 
them the app itself is not to blame actu
ally the app was forged from the same fire 

that produced increased s
ti
 rates instant 
gratification 
the millennial generation 
has grown accustomed to having their 
desires met instantaneously 
the availabil
ity of the internet through virtually any 
electronic device has reinforced demand 

for prompt service smartphones place all 
the worlds knowledge into the palm of 
their users hands 
online retailers make 
driving to the store oldfashioned netflix 

is the product of this generation provid
ing instant access to movies and shows 

without the inconvenience of commercials 

to hinder viewers needs to watch multiple 

seasons of a television show in a single 
day all because desires should be met now 

society wants to lose or gain weight now 
watch television shows now get answers 
to questions immaterial or otherwise 

now society wants sex now and without 

hindrances like courtship health checks 
and contraceptives
regardless of the views on instant grati
fication and the digital era their societal 
impact cannot be doubted sex is now 
available through handheld mobile dating 
apps as change in the societal attitude 

of instant gratitude is not foreseeable it 

would not be farfetched to imagine sex 
becoming more easily attainable as time 
passes so as long as the trend continues 

tinders update is quite commendable 
that is not to say that the application of 
instant gratitude to sex is morally justifi

able as it is not but if sex is happening 

at least there are measures to ensure its 

participants safety

eagleton my parents have just like set 
so many like expectations for 

me and what if like 
i just 
dont know what theyre talk
ing about monica like many 

students today feels trapped by 
the stereotypes that pervade the 

college experience while tour
ing prospective colleges many 

students report an overwhelming 

feeling of academia that leaves 
them wallowing in the bitterness of their 
own ignorance
todd winchester who hopes to gradu
ate in the next seven years with a degree in 

university studies noted the atmosphere 
right away 
i felt pressured to change 
myself to conform 
the social climate 
demands forced me to turn from who 
i was  an apathetic but secretly brilliant 
individual  into another functioning cog 

whose only goal is to improve society 
i felt 
lost after a few weeks of living 

in the skin of someone he didnt 

want to be winchester found 

himself again in an intimate 

soulbaring ceremony known as 

crossfading 
in that moment he 
found who he wanted to be and 
also discovered what the color 
heliotrope felt like
winchester is but one story 
of many 
he couldnt  nor should he 
 have to conform to the stereotypes 

that define college 
he should not have 
to change the selfindulgence and laziness 

that have characterized his life for so long 

students should be breaking free of the 

boxes society has built around them 
the 
best years of ones life shouldnt be given 

over to mindless learning in preparation 

for the future factors like graduation rates 

academic programs and research opportu
nities shouldnt even be considered when 

choosing a school freedom to break free 

from what society expects of students can 

be a life changing experience for many
msu is purportedly an openminded 
and accepting campus 
this however can
not be true until things like classes books 
knowledge and discussion of academic 
topics are no longer the defining qualities 

of the school 
in an effort to get good press 
for once montana 
hall has started the 
drinking in defiance program students 

will work with government employees to 

burn class schedules and host ragers in a 

small but determined effort to break free 

of educational stereotypes president and 

cofounder of the program blake riggins 
provided his stance on the issue 
i want 

to defy shtereotypes said riggins a third 

generation fraternity member as he waited 

for his chance to do a keg stand 
he was 
unavailable for further comment because 

he became enamored with an equally 

inebriated female and they began gyrating 

spastically together
obnoxious dogooders who live in the 
library promote the environment of intoler
ance that riggins is working so hard to ght 
against as a school msu needs to take 
them down a notch by promoting things 

like spit ball wars and hate notes delivered 

to the pretentious bastards during class all 

must do their part to create a better setting 

for intellectually stunted but fully incompe
tent people to embrace their better qualities

close encounters of the 
snowy kind
on a recent trip to jackson hole i le the 
ski resort boundary and hiked towards the 
vicinity of four pines passing the area known 

as rock springs as i went rock springs is a 
technical cliy bowl lled with complex 
terrain nuances that make routending there 

problematic for those who do not intimately 

know the area it lies just past jackson hole 

mountain resorts southern boundary and 

is home to classic ski lines like space walk 
and zero g at one point during my hike i 
stopped to watch a pair of skiers traverse across 

the top of rock springs and descend into zero 

g e two skied the line without incident 

but if they had descended a few hundred feet 

further le they wouldve found themselves in 

ralphs slide ats where an avalanche killed 

two people exactly one week later
            
locals know to avoid ralphs slide e 
group of three skiers that ventured there on 

jan 24 were not locals by all accounts they 

were visiting from out of town perhaps thats 

what led them to descend into a particularly 

treacherous area of the mountain a steep 
slope with a convex rollover it sits above 
a cluster of large clis that makes the line 
particularly dangerous and in the case of 
the jan 24 slide deadly at aernoon the 

group le jacksons southern boundary and 
headed towards rock springs it was upon 
descending into ralphs slide that the trio 

triggered the avalanche two of the skiers 
were caught and subsequently swept over the 
clis below them the third managed to grab 

a tree and avoid becoming caught in the slide  

e two that went over the cli were buried 
and succumbed to trauma sustained in the 
avalanche
a historically deadly 
month
e slide in rock springs was a tragic 
conclusion to an already deadly month across 
the western united states as many people 
perished in avalanches in january 2016 as 
during the entirety of the previous winter in 
total 11 people lost their lives at statistic 
alone makes the month notable but what is 

truly striking is that ten of the 11 fatalities 
occurred during an eight day period between 
jan 16 and jan 24 furthermore additional 
avalanche deaths were recorded in six separate 
states utah montana wyoming colorado 
washington and alaska all recorded at least 
one fatality during this period e scourge of 
deaths leaves a black stain on the white snow 
of many mountain communities in the west 

as few locales have been le untouched
what went wrong in 
rock springs
on the day of the rock springs slide the 
avalanche danger was rated moderate in the 
tetons however this relatively low rating 
did not tell the full story e avalanche 
advisory that was issued the morning of jan 
24 specically called for the possibility for 

backcountry travelers to trigger deeper slabs 
that formed during the last storm cycle in 
addition the advisory stated that ese slabs 
could be up to three feet deep tragically this 
warning would come to fruition later that day 
e skiers that died triggered a deeper slab 
the likes of which the advisory had specically 

noted could be possible at the crown of the 
avalanche in ralphs slide the fracture was 
twotofour feet deep 
eres no treading around the fact that the 
group of skiers who triggered the slide in rock 

springs shouldnt have been there armchair 
quarterbacks are quick to point out that they 
were not equipped with any avalanche safety 
gear and they did not know where they were 
going and thus the tragedy shouldnt come as 
a surprise yet this sort of discourse although 

reasonable to some extent does little to help 
further the discussion about what happened 
that day hindsight is always painfully clear 
particularly when it comes to the subject of 
avalanches what oen seems exceptionally 

obvious aer an avalanche is always less so in 
the moments prior rather than criticize the 
dead one should examine and learn from the 

mistakes that they made so as not to fall into 
the same trap that they did and this brings us 
back to the avalanche rating system 
e avalanche danger 
scale
e fact that this avalanche occurred on a 
day with moderate avalanche danger may 
seem surprising to some aer all moderate is 
the secondlowest rating of the ve categories

however the vast majority of avalanche 
fatalities occur on days when the avalanche 
danger is rated considerable or moderate 
according to the utah avalanche center days 
when the danger is rated considerable account 
for 47 percent of all avalanche fatalities 
while days when the danger is rated moderate 
account for 34 percent surprisingly days 

with high or extreme avalanche danger only 

account for a combined total of 13 percent of 
all fatalities one would infer that days when 
the danger was higher would be more deadly 

but this is not the case e utah avalanche 

center oers a simple explanation as to 
why that is most people go into avalanche 
terrain in the middle danger ratings us 

avalanche fatalities tend to occur when there 

is a maximum interaction between avalanches 

and people ironically its when the avalanche 
danger drops that people statistically tend to 
get into trouble 
far too oen backcountry skiers and 
snowboarders base their decisions o the 

avalanche danger ratings rather than the 
underlying reasons of why the rating is what 
it is to put it bluntly the avalanche danger 
scale is a simple depiction of a world that is 
anything but advisories issued by forecasting 

agencies are an extremely helpful tool in ava
lanche terrain decision making said conner 
haworthe a ski patroller at the yellowstone 
club at being said these advisories should 

only be a part of the process other tools that 

backcountry recreationists should be using to 
assess a particular slope include meteorologi
cal observations stability tests and evaluations 
of risk tolerance in many ways the danger 

rating is like a map and consequently it does 

one little good unless they know how to read 
it just looking at a map can give one a broad 
overview of a general area but it doesnt help 
in the way of actually navigating if one cant 
use it properly likewise the avalanche danger 

rating on its own will do a person little good 

without understanding what the rating is in 

response to one might as well be skiing in a 

mineeld 
probability and risk
classifying the entire avalanche phenomena 
into ve escalating danger levels is in some 

ways counterproductive as it can provide the 

user with a false sense of security for example 

a day with moderate danger is not necessarily 

any safer in terms of consequences than a day 

with high danger e high danger rating could 

be in response to easily triggered wind slabs 

while the moderate rating could be in response 

to lingering deep slab stabilities as was the case 

in rock springs neither avalanche problem 

is necessarily any less deadly than the other  

e avalanche danger scale communicates 

the likelihood of slides it does not necessarily 

correspond to how deadly those individual 

slides may be it is up to the user to synthesize 

the underlying information into their decision 

making as theres no guarantee that a lower 

avalanche danger makes one safer 
none of the people who died in avalanches 
this month thought it was going to happen to 

them many were great skiers with extensive 

backcountry knowledge some were not 

alas each somehow made a mistake that cost 

them their life e snowpack across the west 

this winter is a tricky one particularly in the 

rocky mountains depth hoar can be found 

in many places as well as other lingering 

instabilities ese types of weak layers can 

catch even the most experienced backcountry 

skier o guard and theyre probably not going 

anywhere anytime soon when in doubt dig 

a pit to check the snowpack or simply back 

o eres no shame in playing it safe in a 

problematic snowpack dont become another 

statistic 
a beacon is a necessary part of a backcountry gear kit it could save a life

the mens basketball team fell to the university of 
montana 8072 saturday jan 30 in front of the biggest 
crowd in four years

fans as the cats took on the grizzlies 
the grizzlies 
scored first but the cats took an early four point lead 

off of a threepointer from senior guard marcus colbert 
with four and a half minutes left in the half the bob
cats stretched their lead to seven points leading 3124 

the griz closed out the half on a 106 run and cut the 
deficit to just three points 
freshman 
tyler 
hall got the cats rolling in the 
second half scoring in just the first 13 seconds of play 
the grizzlies answered 
back and four minutes into 
the second half had tied 
the game on a three from 

junior jack lopez 
the 
bobcats responded going 
on an 80 run sparked by a 
layup from senior danny 

robinson and taking a 

5143 lead with twelve and 
a half minutes left in the 
game montana would not 

back down and in the last 

10 minutes of the game the 
lead changed seven times 
before the griz took the 
final lead at the 436 mark 
the griz stretched their lead 
to eight with 36 seconds left and cruised to a 8072 win 
over the bobcats 
while the cats stayed with the griz when looking at 
the scoreboard the grizzlies dominated when it came 

down to rebounds montana outrebounded msu 41
28 and scored 16 secondchance points 
i feel like youve got to credit them but at the same 
time there were a lot of things that they did that came 
down to us rebounding colbert said 
they crashed 
the boards harder than we did and the numbers showed 
it montana also made more trips to the charity stripe 

than the bobcats shooting 2533 to the cats 1418 
you can talk about a lot of different things but 
everything points to toughness montana state 
head 
coach brian fish said 
they were the tougher team 
tonight 
the bobcats were led by colbert who put up 
a teamhigh 21 points and dished out four assists and 

hall who contributed 17 points in the effort montanas 
walter wright put up a gamehigh 24 points for the 

grizzlies 
with the loss the cats fall to 912 overall and 45 in 
the big sky conference and the griz improve to 81 in 

conference play

trick allard
the 100th meeting between the lady bobcats 
and the lady griz happened this past saturday at 
worthington arena 
the arena was pulsating from the 
energy of 3526 fans 
the supportive atmosphere gave 
the cats the will to rally in the fourth quarter and fend 
off a tenacious griz offense to seal the victory 
the first half was a struggle for msu as the bob
cats committed 12 turnovers and struggled in their 
attempts to get the ball inside msu also had a hard 
time containing mccalle feller and 
kayleigh valley 

montanas two most dominant players valley and 

feller average 201 and 177 points per game respec
tively valley is shooting 54 percent from the field this 
season and is hitting at an 83 percent clip from the 

line 
in addition she is second on the team averag
ing 72 rebounds per contest feller is montanas deep 
threat connecting on 54of139 threepoint attempts 
it didnt seem likely after the end of the first half that 
the lady cats would be able to curtail valley and feller 
from running the boards as valley scored a total of 
nine points and feller 12 
to end the half msu junior 
riley nordgaard completed a jumping layup in the 
paint putting montana state at 25 to montanas 30 
the cats entered the second half adjusting defen
sively going toe to toe physically with the griz 
the 
aggressive play style payed off as the cats were able to 

corral valley and feller to single digit point totals in 
the second half 
montanas largest lead came near the end of the 
second period but by the middle of the third period 

this lead was mitigated by a strong offensive surge by 

the cats junior guard peyton ferris and nordgaard led 
with 16 and 11 total points respectively with some 
help from senior guard lindsay stockton and senior 

forward alexa dawkins the cats managed to tie the 

game about midway through the third period 
with 839 left to play bobcat senior forward jas
mine 
hommes gave montana state its first lead since 
the opening quarter connecting on a layup in the paint 
nordgaard would secure the lead that the cats would 
maintain for the rest of the game with an oldfashioned 

threepoint play with 403 remaining
following a free throw by montanas feller at the 
354 mark msu scored seven unanswered points 

capped by a nordgaard layup on an assist from stock
ton stockton went threeoffour at the line down the 
stretch that resulted in the 6152 win for montana 
state
overall the game was extremely close 
in fact the 
lead changed hands five times just within the closing 

stanza of the game highlighting just how tight the play 

was

ere comes a point in everyones outdoor 
pursuits that everything clicks ey get the 
onsight stick the landing pork the pow and 
become total hardcore crushers e feeling 
associated with getting it right is a mixture 
of bliss joy  and extreme ego aunting e 

more and more one tends to get away with 

things they should otherwise fail at their ego 
grows little by little without control it can 
erupt into a dangerous annoying sprayasau
rus rex as weve gone over before nobody 
likes that luckily there is quite an easy way 

to keep this thing called the ego in check 

failure 
or bailing bailure as 
i like to call it
 ambition is a fantastic and wonderful 
trait ose that are ambitious are driven and 

stoked and all around good people to hang 

out with ambition also leads to preposter
ous ideas which with the outdoors can lead 

to good old fashion bailure dreams get 

planted and plans for epic adventures get 

loosely planned dreams like we can totally 

do a link up of e fellowship and skyline 

in a day human powered or lets do a single 

day traverse of the crazies ese audacious 

goals can also be much simpler taking the 

form of a poorly planned dream planning to 

ski hidden couloirs without knowing where 

they are deciding to go bike sypes canyon 

despite the sun setting and not having a head
lamp assuming you can denitely onsight 

a hard 511 multipitch climb o the couch 
 these are just some examples of wonderful 
opportunities of experiencing bailure
bailure is ultimately just an annoying 
way to say failure or bailing or bailing from 

failure on an objective you have been doing 

it sounds more hardcore than straight up 
failure 
i myself am quite a bailure enthusi

ast partaking in an act of bailure every few 

weeks or so such as over break when my 
friend payson and 
i decided that it would 
be a great idea to skin into champagne 
sherbet  a climb located in the east fork 
of hyalite canyon a simple climb one that 
i have climbed before we assumed it would 

be a mellow skin with 45pound packs to the 

base quickly climb up check out some other 
climbs ski out and call it a day we ended up 
skinning in unconsolidated snow for miles in 
the wrong direction due to my stubbornness 
getting lost and falling multiple times over 
logs resulting in scrapes and profanity not 
allowed in the exponent 
since the day was getting late we gave 
up because as the saying goes when the 

going gets tough why not quit payson 
and i ended up failing to even nd one of 
the more popular climbs in 
hyalite we had 
an encounter with bailure just a few weeks 
prior we also got separated and he got lost at 
history rock a few weeks before that we 
got lost skiing in a dierent spot in 
hyalite 
did this make us curse and despise the great 
outdoors no and we bailed in style laugh
ing and making fools of ourselves behind al
most any great alpinist skier or backcountry 

hermit lies multiple failed attempts perhaps 
some failed attempts due to stupid reasons 
and that is totally ok because if you suc
ceeded all the time where would the fun be
the art of bailure theres no shame in calling it a day

snow falls in big fat flakes on my eye
lashes 
i blink to keep it from getting in 
my eyes 
i came early this morning before 

the sun to sit in a clump of snowcovered 
bushes and scan the wild montana sky for 
big canada geese a few minutes pass be
fore 
i see a flock flying in a v and head
ing my way with their distinctive hhhhh

onk i breathe click off my safety and 
focus in on the lead bird 
its cold before the sun comes up 
the 
heater in my car is slow to get warm so 

i put all my layers on before 
i leave the 

house 
i do one last pocket pat to make 
sure 
i have everything and then 
i grab my 
gun lock the door and head out into the 
430 am darkness 
im tired on the drive 
over eyelids heavy with sleep that hasnt 
yet dispersed 
i turn on my radio and open 
the window  that wakes me right up
the first fingers of dawn are starting 
to reach up when 
i get to the parking 

lot i start to see oranges and reds and 
that bluepurple early morning light 
it 
promises to be a gorgeous sunrise but if 

im up and about so are the geese 
i grab 
my goose gun an old overunder ten 
gauge with double triggers that kicks like 
a mule and takes basketball sized chunks 
out of trees at fifteen yards and my pack 
and start the walk out to my spot in the 
bushes
the week before 
i had been fishing and 
noticed a huge flock of geese just sit
ting right on the edge of the pond in the 
afternoon so my plan is to come in before 
they do and wait for a shot 
i shoulder my 
way through thick brush that scratches 

at my face and sticks greedy burrs to my 
clothes all of a sudden 
i break through 
the trees and the smell hits me the smell 

of slow moving marshy water and cat
tails 
the ground becomes soft under my 
leather boots and 
i sink up to my ankles 
in some spots less than a few steps in and 
im already caked with mud scratched 
by sticks and stuck full of burrs  but 
i dont mind
right at the edge of the tree line is an 
open field of marsh and this open field 
lies between me and the bushes at the 

edge of the pond  between me and the 
geese 
i havent beaten them to their spot 

at all and now there are two hundred 
yards of open field for me to cross with 
only the occasional bush to use as cover 

i get low and start to make my way into 
shooting range 
i get to about 80 yards 
before the geese spot me and slowly but 
surely in groups of two then three then 

ten they fly away 
i sit in the bushes 

anyways and settle in hoping 
i can get 

another flock to come in which brings 

me back to the beginning 
i grab my call and give a friendly couple 
of honks 
the birds start to talk back to 
me and the lead goose banks in my direc

tion 
i give another twohonk and the 

birds respond just out of shooting range 

they see something they dont like and 

pass me by 
i give one last forlorn call hop
ing to draw them back but no dice a few 

hours later and 
i havent seen anything 
else so i decide to call it a day
its a sad truth that when hunting the 
walk back is much longer if youre empty 
handed 
its also true that even though 
youre empty handed its not a bad walk 

i got to spend the morning watching the 
sun come up over still waters 
i got to 
spend the morning listening to randy 
hauser sing about a goodnight kiss 
i got 
to spend the morning talking to birds 
and watching them fly 
i got to spend the 

morning sitting by a pond listening to 

crickets and songbirds 
i got to spend the 

morning goose hunting

muir quartet concert 
deranges chamber music
by 
keegan grady
say the words chamber music 
and you can watch peoples eyes 
glaze over e words conjure 
images of stuy elites highbrow 

culture and hours of music that 
to many is just plain boring 
e montana chamber music 

society is debunking that myth 
on wednesday jan 27 a quartet 
of musicians presented classical 
music with a modern twist
e combination of musicians 
onstage was enough to generate 

attention  cellist sara stalker 

pianist philip aaberg electric 
violinist 
tracy silverman and 
msu violin professor angella 

ahn each is a renowned musician 
in their own right and together 

they were truly memorable e 
two violins  one acoustic and 
one electric  were especially in
teresting to hear both had unique 
voices and neither ever took 

center stage silverman and ahn 
mixed perfectly trading melodic 
lines easily and uidly
e music itself was no less fas
cinating e concerts second half 

was mendelssohns piano 
trio no 
1 in d minor but the majority of 
the concert wasnt purely classical 
e program called it a potpourri 

of jazz e musicians had taken 

classical pieces and arranged 
them in new ways and gave the 
audience what silverman jokingly 

called classical derangements 
for demonstration aaberg played 
a piece from bachs ree part 
inventions as it was meant to 
sound en he and silverman 
launched into a funky version e 
piece owed eortlessly from clas
sical to jazz extremes e original 
melody was never completely lost 

but was joined by echoes of jazz 

standards such as blue skies 
and it dont mean a ing 
it 
nished with a big dixielandstyle 
end both aaberg and silverman 
improvising melodies which inter
twined to a nal ringing note
e derangements were a large 
part of the evening but by no 
means all of it 
original composi
tions were also given a good show
ing silverman played a oneman 
piece with the assistance of a loop 
pedal  when melodies are played 

and then looped they continue 
to be heard aer the musician has 
stopped playing them himself 
e piece was called matisse la 
danse aer a painting by the 

famous artist 
henri matisse 
it 
consisted of six voicings of silver
mans violin with ve representing 

the dancers in the painting each 

melody had a unique personality 

and each was played simultane
ously so the piece began to sound 

like a rowdy joyous party e 

sixth voice was silverman impro
vising
aaberg and ahn also played 
one of aabergs original composi
tions a piece called nevertheless 
hello e title was taken from a 
1965 ursula andress lm and was 

a complex and beautiful work e 
main theme was a rolling triad
like melody which would vanish 

periodically only to reappear 
some time later e piece had a 
light beautiful lilt to its rhythms 
and gave a nostalgic mood to the 
room
e evening continued with 
other originals and rewritten clas
sical pieces until the second half 

of the performance en a trio of 

aaberg ahn and stalnaker took 

to the stage for mendelssohns 
piano 
trio no 1 e perfor
mance banished any doubts about 
classical musics power from the 
tense beginnings of the molto 
allegro ed agitato to the lively 

scherzo to the energetic ending 
the work showcased the talents of 
the musicians perfectly
classical music may always 
have a connotation of the world 
of snobby culture but for anyone 
in the audience the concert was 

proof that that neednt be the case 
e performances were energetic 
and inspired the banter with the 
audience was easy and the music 
was full of passion and beauty 

perhaps classical music isnt so 
boring aer all

orfe rst few months of the year are always 
mildly depressing for gamers few big names 
release in the beginning which makes it 

dicult to nd fun games to play 
titles like 
call of duty assassins creed and other 

blockbuster hits dont usually come out until 
late 
october or early november leaving gam
ers to play old games or squander for medio
cre games to nd 
however there are usually 
an abundance of january releases that fall by 
the wayside that deserve every gamers time 

e best release in january in my opinion is 

crashlands
in crashlands you play as the galactic 
spacetrucker flux dabes during a trucking 

run your ship is blown to smithereens by the 

villainous 
hewgodooko who tears your ship 
apart looking for new technology anks to 
him you are now crashlanded on woanope 
an unfamiliar planet where you only have 
one primary goal live long enough to get 

o of there with only your trusty sidekick 
juicebox you are tasked to retrieve the lost 
packages nd a way o the planet and fulll 
your quest but everything isnt quite what it 
seems on woanope 
as you scramble to retrieve your packages 
you stumble upon a plot of world domina
tion being the protagonist of this unusual 

tale it is your job to stop the world from be
ing dominated while this may seem like ev
ery other spacehero game ever made things 
arent nearly as straightforward in crash
lands as they are in games like 
halo 
in the 
more mainstream titles there is a set path 

for you to take in order to save the universe 
from its imminent demise which consists of 
collected quests shooting aliens getting the 
girl and making everything hunkydory in 
the long run crashlands isnt 
like that
in crashlands you have to 
gure everything out yourself 
in order to save everyone you 
will need to utilize the dierent 

resources on woanope to cra 
weapons make shelter and stay 
alive is takes a bit of time to 
learn but is incredibly rewarding 
when you get it all gured out 

craing a powerful weapon to 
destroy things feels a lot more 
satisfying than walking around and comi
cally slapping everything until it coughs up 
juicy resources apart from craing there is 
a lot more you can do e various citizens of 
woanope will have an abundance of quests 
for you to accomplish that will cause them 
to aid you in your travels with resources 

and other various perks you can also tame 
aliens to help ght for you or 

just become friends with you if 

youre some sort of pacist or 

something
crashlands provides an over
whelming amount of variety 

and fun to a time of year where 

there simply isnt a lot to be had 

with video games ere is a ton 

to do from ghting aliens to 

building a shelter thatll make 
everyone else jealous 
it is a highlight in what could have been an incred
ibly boring month
crashlands is available on steam for 
1499 for more information about the

onkblack mass
johnny depp takes a break 
from being weird to transform into one of 
the most intimidating gangsters in ameri
can history 
in what is widely considered to 
be a careerbest performance depp plays 
james whitey bulger godfather of bos

tons 
irish mob and generally unsettling hu
man being based on reallife events black 
mass follows whitey as he teams up with 
his brother billy bulger a state senator and 
john connolly an fb
i agent in an eort to 
take down the 
italian maa as events take 
a turn for the worse whitey begins to spiral 

out of control transforming into one of 

the most violent criminals of the 1970s and 

quickly killing his way on to the fb
is most 
wanted list 
black mass isnt for the faint of heart 
 it has enough brutal violence to warrant 

some seriously long blinks if you catch my 

dri and whether or not this excessive 

violence is always benecial to the story 
is debateable also the fact that the fb
i genuinely allowed this man to run amok 
for as long as they did is somewhat nauseat
ing e intrinsic appeal of black mass is 

rooted in its based on true events nature 
 though even then its only depps stun
ning performance that elevates the lm to 
a level it might not have reached otherwise 

is is essential viewing for anyone who 

loves a good gangster lm  or anyone who 
appreciates a good performance

spectre
spectre is unfortunately 
an apt title as this lm is a 
mere ghost of its predeces

sor the innitely better skyfall e lm 

takes the thematic elements of skyfall and 

attempts to copy them to weak eect  
whether it was creating a juicy iconic villain 
establishing emotional resonance with 

james bonds past or even commissioning 
an amazing song by a massively popular art
ist 
it all falls at
spectre sees james bond hunting down 
a sinister organization one that operates 
entirely in the shadows and seems to have 
one singular purpose be evil 
in terms of 
secret shadowy organizations in recent spy 
lms the syndicate in mission 
impos
sible  rogue nation was innitely more 

interesting and better developed creating 
more compelling drama 
if the villain is 
the heart of a james bond lm spectre 

needed a transplant before the ink dried on 
the screenplay meanwhile the story itself 

is confusing but not in a good mind
boggling way  more like in a well this 

could have been executed better way even 
the lms big reveal feels hollow 
if youre a 
james bond completist then spectre is a 
mustsee but nonfans should probably stay 
far away

the hunger games 

mockingjay part 2
reviewing booktomovie 
adaptations is a little more 

dicult than reviewing an average lm es
pecially when it comes to these young adult 
adaptations which are muchmaligned but 
rarely justiably so ey made a movie 
aimed at teenagers not the academy 
know 
the audience and quit hatin at being 
said e 
hunger games mockingjay part 
2 is more universally enjoyable than other 

adaptations as long as youre familiar with 
the events of the previous three lms 
in the nal installment of the series 
katniss 

everdeen is tasked with leading the rebellion 
as they surge against president snow and 

the glittering capital meanwhile she is 
also trying to heal her love peeta  who 
was tortured into insanity  and keep her 
family safe
e 
hunger games series has always 
been more topical than average young 

adult fare touching on topics as seemingly 
harmless as reality 
tv to important issues 
like inequality and war 
its managed to do 
this against the backdrop of a unique world 

and actionpacked story and that doesnt 
change in mockingjay part 2 with more 

than a few surprises and a handful of heart
wrenching moments mockingjay part 2 is 

denitely worth a watch

onja ben
to
nits the year 618 bce e 
tang dynasty rules china and 
tea leaves are steamed and formed 
into bricks for easy trade about 

350 years later during the song 

dynasty this bricked tea begins 

to be pulverized into powder is 

powder is whipped into hot water 

using a whisk and is christened 

matcha  literally meaning 

powdered tea
from the beginning matcha 
was more than 

just powdered 

tea e tea 

became popular 
among zen and 
chan buddhists 
ey drank the 
teas in elaborate 
spiritual ceremo
nies 
in fact the 
earliest extant 

chan monastic 

code describes 

etiquette for tea 

ceremonies
while the tea 
eventually fell 

out of favor in 

china buddhism carried it to ja
pan where it continued to thrive 

matcha was eventually used as 

avoring to make green tea mochi 

and ice cream along with other 

popular foods 
matcha however is dicult to 
grow e tea leaves are grown in 

shade making them a darker green 

than sunlightexposed tea leaves 

tea buds are handpicked laid at 
and dried aer being destemmed 

and deveined the remaining 
leaf is grinded into a bright green 
powder 
it can take an hour to 
grind just 30 grams of matcha to 

the appropriate neness
traditionally matcha is prepared 
by siing the tea through a ne 
sieve using a wooden spatula or a 

smooth stone e tea for ceremo
nial purposes at least is then placed 

into a small tea caddy called a 

chaki using a bamboo scoop called 
chashaku a small amount of tea is 
placed into a bowl 
hot but not 
boiling water is then added and 

mixed to uniform consistency us
ing a chasen or bamboo whisk no 

clumps should remain nor should 
any powder remain on the sides of 
the bowl matcha is traditionally 
served with a small sweet intended 

to be eaten before drinking the tea 
since it is not served with milk or 

sugar and has a bitter taste 
more modern ways of serving 
matcha include drinking it as a 
frothy latte like 
at the daily cof
fee shop where 

the tea is simply 
whisked with hot 
water and added 
to steamed milk 
more traditional 
and modern 

preparations are 
served at 
town
shends 
teahouse 
where you can 

buy grams of mat
cha and chasen 
to make the tea 
at home many 
other coee shops in town also 
serve variations of matcha but it is 

still not overwhelmingly popular in 
montana or the us 
since you consume the tea leaf in 
matcha beverages they oer a host 
of health benets matcha is rich in 
antioxidants and some studies sug
gest that it helps boost metabolism 
further matcha is much more 
caeinated than other green teas 
dont let the caeine content fool 
you though since matcha was tra
ditionally connected to buddhist 
tea ceremonies it has always been 
associated with meditation 
while classes start to pick up 
grab a matcha latte and take a 

second to decompress 
itll help 
you stay awake for the rest of the 
day and hopefully remind you to 
take a moment to yourself instead 
of panicking about your rst paper

fight for choice forum brings community together to discuss womens health
by lilly brogger
issues of womens health have recently 
taken a front stage politically and socially 
many planned parenthood clinics have been 

defunded across the nation causing concern 

over access to reproductive healthcare
 e fight for choice forum was held on 
feb 10 at the procrastinator eatre orga
nized by students for choice e fword 

montana advocates for sexual health and 

planned parenthood of montana the event 

commemorated the anniversary of the roe 

vs wade decision which legalized abortion 

in 1973
martha stahl ceo of planned parent
hood montana spoke at the event she be
lieves that womens health is always a priority 

but should be especially important to women 

today stahl spoke about the political issues 

concerning abortion and how disagreements 

over abortion also aect access to other 

womens health services
she discussed issues that occurred in texas 
when a law caused many planned parenthood 

clinics to shut down e remaining clinics 

became overrun and many women could 

no longer receive care stahl emphasized 

that pregnancies went up and women were 

waiting longer to get abortions she also 

discussed colorado which beneted from 

implementing measures to increase access to 

birth control
stahl said that location should not dictate 
a womans access to care eir ability to 

access abortion care shouldnt come down to 

what their zip code is
ose wanting to defund planned parent
hood primarily staunch republicans have 

criticized the organization saying it does 

not actually serve women stahl responded 

to this saying as a person that works so 

closely with our healthcare providers to say 

that providers like planned parenthood dont 

have womens best interests in mind is just 

preposterous
stahl acknowledged that everyone has the 
right to either be for or against abortion but 

believes that the majority of people actually 

agree about providing women with reproduc

tive healthcare she explained that supporting 

providers like planned parenthood makes 

sense even for people who are prolife because 

access to birth control decreases pregnancy 

and abortions rates
stahl concluded by saying in the end 
the decision of whether or not to continue 

a pregnancy should be the decision of the 

woman
bozeman community member betsy 
deleiris also spoke at the event sharing her 
story about her own experience with womens 

health as a young woman deleiris became 

pregnant with a man she did not believe she 

could raise a child with due to instability 

in their relationship i knew that i was ill

equipped to raise a child on my own deleiris 

said
planned parenthood was already her 
healthcare provider and she chose to pursue 

terminating the pregnancy she had a consul
tation and went through with an abortion 

reecting on her experience she said when 

i le the oce that day i felt absolutely sup

wicklund fund which was founded to

cannot aord an abortion was also part of 

the panel she read from wicklunds book

of wicklunds involvement with abortion as

asmsu executives push for movement in polling location change
by ted weeks
in an ongoing threemonth long eort to 
make voting more accessible to the msu 
community asmsu leaders are continuing 
a dialogue with gallatin county commis
sioners on the topic of moving a polling 
location to msu previously voting for three 

precincts was done at the gallatin county 
fairgrounds a central location that asmsu 
president levi birky and vice president 
holly capp agree allowed voters without 
motorized transportation to travel to the 
polls with reasonable ease due to the data 
found in the 2010 census however this 

location has been replaced by hope lutheran 
church as the areas polling location 
located two miles south of campus on 
19th avenue the new polling place is not 
on a public transportation route for use by 
voters and does not have safe bike lanes and 
sidewalks leading to the church birky said 

that students will be negatively aected by 
this change obviously thats a concern for 
us because a lot of students dont have cars 
county commissioners met the requests to 
move polling locations with resistance birky 

and capp recalled the concerns the commis

sioners voiced during their meeting eyre 
very reluctant because the voter turnout for 
people our age is low eyre afraid its only 

going to accommodate a small population 

capp said 
another area of concern for the commis
sioners was that a move to campus will make 
it harder for some people to vote according 
to birky accessibility regarding parking and 

the ow of heavy election day trac is good 

at hope lutheran where voters can easily 
park and walk into the polling area while 
those living in town might be more likely to 
vote it will be harder for voters further south 

of town to reach the polling location accord
ing to commissioner don seifert
birky rebutted this statement saying 
hope lutheran is a good location for people 

that have a car to those that dont have 

transportation its kind of disenfranchising 
he believes that voting should be available to 
all and the current location does not provide 

that birky said voting is a civic right not 

just to the select few but to everyone capp 

agreed we should be making voting ac

cessible to everyone part of this issue is that 

if its not accessible people wont turn out
according to capp the total estimated 
cost of moving one of the three precincts 
scheduled to vote will be 2000 is cost 
will likely be covered by a combination of 

funds from asmsu and private sponsors 
ose who would like to voice their opin
ions on the issue are encouraged to attend the 

public comment with county commissioners

 5asmsu senate approves 
resolution in support of 
 
creating bobcat food pantry
by julie donagan
the creation of the bobcat food 
pantry a food pantry to serve msu 
students and prevent food insecurity on 

campus is becoming a reality it would 
be located on campus and available 
to all students in order to utilize this 

resource students need only show a 

catcard or provide a student identifi
cation number and photo id
the idea and structure for the food 
pantry was developed as a capstone 

project by a class of students in the sus
tainable food and bioenergy systems 

program an interdisciplinary program 

within the college of education 
health and human development and 
the college of agriculture the class 

was led by anna diffenderfer program 
leader for sustainable food systems 
students worked on the project 

throughout the fall 2015 semester
according to the united states 
department of agriculture economic 

research service 61 percent of the 

montana population selfidentified as 
having low food security 
defined as reporting of 

reduced quality variety 

or desirability of diet 
with little or no indica
tion of reduced food 
intake additionally 
 54 percent reported 

being very food insecure 

defined as reporting of 

multiple indications of 
disrupted eating patterns and reduced 
food intake
the capstone class conducted their 
own survey of msu students at the 

beginning of their course of approxi
mately 300 responding students 1156 
percent reported being food insecure 

and an additional 19 percent reported 

being very food insecure survey 
participants cited lack of time money 
resources to acquire food transporta
tion and knowledge of food preparation 
as reasons for food insecurity half of 
responding students expressed interest 

in utilizing a campus food pantry with 

32 percent saying they would use the 
resource and 18 percent said maybe
once the need for a food pantry was 
identified the project moved forward 
students stated their objectives being 
to eliminate hunger within the msu 
community reduce stigma regarding 
hunger redistribute foods and educate 
the msu community on food security 

nutrition and innovative ways of utiliz
ing foods they planned 

to work with local busi
nesses university food 
services and the gallatin 
valley food bank to put 
their project into action
initially the project 
was brought to the of

fice of sustainability

in response asmsus liaisons to 

the office of sustainability senators 
geneva zoltek and thomas marts

unconventional path to success
by 
dakotah
 whiting
michael ruiz grew up in innercity 
los angeles and is a fifth year first
generation college student at msu ruiz 
has a unique field of study he laughed 

and said its a bit confusing i am a 

physical anthropologist major with a 

blend of biomechanical engineering i 

am interested in the mechanics of why 
humans are the way they 
are and how theyre able 

to move 
being a firstgener
ation student ruizs 

educational journey was 

not easy to come by at 

19 years of age a high 
school dropout i was 
confident that i had 

the tools necessary to 

succeed independently 

in the world inevitably i immediately 

failed at this ruiz wrote in a statement 

of purpose essay for the harvard univer
sity graduate program because he was 

the first in his family to attend college 

his family is pretty much just cheerlead
ers and thats fine but they dont know 

how to offer the right kind of support 

it really isolates me from my family 

he went on to share that being a first
generation student is a hard adjustment 
i struggled figuring out how to network 

with my professors after five years i am 

finally just now starting to get it 
in 2014 ruiz was granted the op
portunity through the national student 

exchange program at msu to study at 
stony brook university an elite research 
university near long island in new 
york i was never more than a mile 
from the beach ruiz grinned from 

20142015 even though ruiz was an 
undergraduate he conducted graduate 
school level research in the interdepart
mental doctoral program in anthropo
logical sciences i was thrown into the 

lions den ruiz joked but i surprised 
myself when i did well 
i did the exchange pro
gram to go to a place with 
real experts in my field the 
grad students and profes

sors took me under their 
wing and showed me how 
to navigate and network the 

school i can definitely see 

myself doing phd work 
there in the future ruiz 
explained to any students 
hoping to take part in the national 
student exchange program he advises 
to really think about where you want to 

go big cities are hard to adjust to if you 
are not familiar with that lifestyle most 
important make sure they have the right 

resources needed to help you succeed 
ruiz is currently in the hectic process 
of waiting to hear back from gradu
ate schools i am a horribly anxious 

personi jump at every email he 

nervously laughed in the meantime 

ruiz will continue his research under 
the mentorship of ron june phd in 
the mechanical engineering department 

at msu

msu bozeman community push 
 to change name of columbus day
by 
dave
 biegel
msu and the bozeman community may 
be given a new reason to celebrate this 
october university and community teams 

are pushing proposals through the asmsu 

senate and the bozeman city council that 

if accepted would recognize indigenous 

peoples day instead of columbus day
columbus day a national holiday cel
ebrated on the second monday of october 

each year became a federal holiday in 1937 
it began as a celebration of christopher 
columbus arrival to the americas on oct 

12 1492 although the holiday is recog
nized federally state and local governments 

can choose whether or not to observe 

columbus day currently alaska hawaii 

oregon and south dakota do not observe 

the holiday at the state level although 
montana recognizes columbus day the 
city of bozeman does not observe the 
holiday and businesses and schools remain 
open msu does not give students the day 

off on columbus day but rather exchanges 

the holiday for the friday after thanksgiv
ing to give students a longer thanksgiving 

weekend
many individuals and groups within the 
native and indigenous communities find 

the history of columbus and the day of cel
ebration in his honor to be both wrong and 

offensive indigenous people are defined 

as people having a set of specific rights 

based on their historical ties to a particular 

territory and their cultural or historical 

distinctiveness from other populations that 

are often politically dominant elemen
tary students across the country learn the 

rhyme in 1492 columbus sailed the 

ocean blue and are expected to memorize 

that date as the discovery of america many 

native people consider this contradictory 
and hurtful as they had ancestors living 
on the continent thousands of years before 

columbus ever stepped foot on a ship 
the presidential proclamation of co
lumbus day 2015 as found on the white 

house website attempts to address the 

detrimental effects of columbuss arrival on 

the people who already lived in america 

previously unseen disease devastation and 
violence were introduced to the indige
nous peoples lives  and as we pay tribute 
to the ways in which columbus pursued 
ambitious goals  we also recognize the 
suffering inflicted upon native americans 
and we recommit to strengthening tribal 
sovereignty and maintaining our strong 
ties many in the native and indigenous 
communities find the recognition of suf

fering as insufficient and the celebration of 

columbus as offensive indigenous peoples 
day does not only attempt to address the 
wrongs inflicted on native americans in 

the time of columbus but also to recog
nize the hardships that indigenous people 
face currently and to celebrate an indig
enous culture that still exists today
the first example of columbus day 
being changed to indigenous peoples day 
was in 1992 in berkeley california since 

then many cities and universities across 
the country have officially recognized 
indigenous peoples day as a holiday some 

cities in observance are portland oregon 

st paul minnesota seattle and mis
soula whose city council voted in favor of 
celebrating indigenous peoples day last 

october brown university in rhode island 

just joined the list of universities observ
ing indigenous peoples day by voting 

to change columbus day to indigenous 

peoples day last week 
marsha small adjunct instructor in the 
department of native american studies 

is a leading community member in support 

of indigenous peoples day both at the city 

and university level small called the story 

of christopher columbus an interpretive 
paradox of history she said she would like 
to not only correct the history surrounding 

columbus but also address the historical 

trauma of the indigenous people small 
believes in initiating the change as soon as 
possible why wait she asked colum
bus day represents 79 years of historical 

wrong and trauma that is still happening 

right now to native peoples
on jan 17 a resolution presented by in
digenous peoples day bozeman authored 

by sheldon spotted elk ruth ann hall 

swaney marsha f small and marsha m 

fulton and sponsored by native american 
studies at montana state university was 
presented before the bozeman city coun
cil the resolution proposed that the mayor 
and city of bozeman declare the second 
monday of october as indigenous peoples 
day small said that indigenous peoples 
day bozeman has a meeting with the mayor 

this week to refine the resolution and that 

things look good feel good and theres 
great energy 
indigenous peoples day montana state 
university a student run facilitation pre
sented a proposal before the asmsu coun
cil that called to recognize indigenous peo
ples day as a university observed holiday 
at msu according to small indigenous 

peoples day montana state university has 

hundreds of members including msu staff 
students and community members that are 
in support of this cause
ethan tyler walker a graduate student in 
the department of native american studies 

and treasurer of the montana state chapter 

of the society of american indian graduate 

students wanted to emphasize that indig
enous peoples day is not just for native 

americans but for all indigenous peoples 

all over the world who have suffered colo
nialism genocide and cultural genocide
according to the us census bureau 66 
percent or approximately 6750 montanans 

are american indian or native alaskan 

this is significantly higher than the na
tionwide average of 13 percent montana 

recognizes 13 individual tribes within the 

state and has seven designated reservations 
according to the annual institution reports 
on the msu website 249 students at msu 

identify as american indian or native 

alaskan or approximately 2 percent of the 

university population 
if both indigenous peoples day mon
tana state university and indigenous peo
ples day bozemans initiatives go through 
montana state would join many universi
ties across the country a list that includes 

uc berkeley university of utah brown 

university university of montana and cu 
denver along with many other universities 
and bozeman will join an ever growing list 

of major cities who have adopted indig
enous peoples day

how to get students tunedin on financial literacy
during the time i lived in nova 
scotia one of the most im
portant pieces of wisdom to grace 

my ears was people without infor
mation cannot act people 

with information cannot 

help but act 
  originally coined by the man
agement guru ken blanchard 

this phrase never seemed more 

applicable than within the world 

of nance
we live in a world where 
upwards of 60 percent of students graduate 

with student debt with total loan debt in 

the us climbing well over a trillion dollars 

it comes as no surprise then to discover 

that nance remains one of the chief issues 

of concern amongst the millennial genera
tion
however no matter how concerned 
americans may be about their nancial 

situation overall nancial literacy in the 

usa remains abysmal
is lack of education cannot be at
tributed to lack of opportunity while not 

every high school oers courses on how to 

manage nances the sheer wealth of infor
mation at the ngertips of highschool and 

collegeage students is staggering a search 

of bing using the key words free online 

financial literacy course yields 347 

million results if only a mere hundredth of 
a percent of those results were useful that 

would leave well over 300 sources to work 

with
additional opportunities to learn nance 
can be found in public libraries in open 
seminars on college campuses 

eg msus oce of student 

success and in the homes of 

many prospective students either 

from their parents or from other 

sources of experience
e problem lies not in access 
to nancial information or in the 

lack of training of how to apply 

that information but instead in 

that students just do not take the 
time to think about these things until grim 

reality comes knocking at their door and it 

is too late
ere are a lot of reasons for this apathy 
but if i had to identify a basic principle at 

work in preventing students from taking 

action when it comes to their nancial 

futures i would say out of sight out of 

mind
ats what makes the recent work of 
msu professors carly urban and chris 

stoddard so interesting
in their 2015 paper does salient 
financial information aect academic 

performance and borrowing behavior 

among college students urban and 

stoddard address the relation between 

nancial education and the nancial deci

sions students make later in life e paper 

describes urban and stoddards study of an 
experiment in which msu students with 

considerable debt received know your 

debt letters that reminded them of their 

debt and oered nancial advice including 

incentivized oers for oneonone nancial 

counseling
of particular interest is that the studies 
found that students who received targeted 

information about debt levels and counsel
ing oers increased semester gpas and 

credits were more likely to switch to a 

stem major and reduced borrowing levels 

the subsequent semester relative to their 

peers and that overall this relatively low
cost intervention that provided nancial 

information and oered counseling to 

students with potentially risky levels of debt 

led to large behavioral changes 
e methods suggested by urban and 
stoddard are still subject to review and 

change but in order for students to take 

command of their nancial futures the 

issues of nance need to be brought to their 

attention only then can they act in fact 

as blanchard said they cannot help but 

act and if a simple letter makes even the 

smallest dierence in that regard then it is 

something worth looking into

for change we live in a much more 

socially conscious time but we are still 

blind to many issues we can only 
aect change when we all take a stand 

for what matters
on may 7 2016 i will be the rst 
person in my family to earn a bach
elors degree a prize that was not easily 

attained in innercity los angeles 

where i grew up success is measured 

by the amount of government public 

assistance one can collect eg food 

stamps e only male role models in 

my family were incarcerated through 

much of my upbringing conse
quently at 19years of age a high 

school dropout i was condent that 

i had the tools necessary to succeed 

independently in the world inevitably 

i immediately failed at this 
during the struggle for my degree 
and the events leading up to my decision 

to pursue a degree i recalled clearly that 

every time i was confronted with adver
sity i would question myself could i 

succeed did i deserve to ese ques

tions kept me cycling through thoughts 

of unworthiness and as a result i 

became homeless alone and trapped 
aer a year of living as a homeless 
person i found a sense of accountability 

that allowed me to dig myself out of this 

cycle in refusing to label myself as un
worthy or incapable i set my mind in 

motion towards the search for a greater 

possibility instead of conceding to my 

limitations i was motivated by the ways 

in which i could learn grow and thrive 

i made a conscious decision to stand 
tall change my life and face the world 

rather than live on my knees erefore 

it only made sense that my next step 

would be to become the rst person 

in my family to attend college pursue 

a meaningful career and to develop a 

profound legacy 
without the various skills and 
resources that more auent students 

tend to have we as minority or dis

advantaged students are much more 

likely to drop out of school in my ex
perience msu like many institutions 

largely ignores the special challenges 

that rst generation and minority 

students face when they arrive to 

campus i have to come to realize that 

the institution rather all institutions 
of higher education in general have no 
idea what to do with a nontraditional 

student meaning those that perhaps 

did not nish high school are rst 

in their families to go to university 

lowincome and identify as a member 

of a racialethnicsexual minority i 

have rsthand experience of feeling 

overlooked by the institution because 

i identify as a member of all of the 

above mentioned groups

what would it take changing 
your moral structure
well i dont feel any dierent 
my friend sarcastically mut
tered as everyone was applauding at the 

close of the presentation our place in the 

universe put on by the veritas forum was 

a discussion between a christian 

physicist and an agnostic philoso
pher about the big questions in 

life such as why are we here 

or is there a god going into it 

my friends and i were all stoked 

two very educated people with 

two very dierent belief systems 

were going to try to convince us 

to think in a new way person
ally id like to consider myself 

somebody who is always open and willing 

to be persuaded or convinced to believe in 

dierent ways provided my qualications 

are met until the two presenters were 

faced with the question of what would it 

take for you to be persuaded to believe in a 

dierent way than your own i realized i 

didnt know what my qualications were a 

dialogue like the veritas forum helped me 
realize what it would take for me to rebuild 

my moral construct
when the two men presenting were asked 
about their qualications for changing 

their belief systems they were both visibly 
thrown o aer an entire debate 

of being calm cool and col
lected you could see each mans 

eyes look around in space for an 

answer as put together as their 

outts as i watched the two men 

on stage try to come up with an 

answer i began to search myself 

for an answer i became aware of 

the fact that i had never pushed 

myself to think of an instance 
where my beliefs would be changed which 

made me feel like a hypocrite in classes and 

dialogues that ive participated in i have 

always preached having an open mind and 

listening harder when you disagree with 

somebody yet here i was not knowing what 

it would take for me to change stances 
e christian physicist basically said 
exactly what anybody would expect him 
to say that he would need solid proof that 

there was no god when the agnostic 

philosopher answered he did what a lot of 

philosophers tend to do circle around the 

answer with big words and then nish with 

a question what i gathered from his re
sponse is that many of the morals and rules 

in most religions would have to change for 

his beliefs to be swayed e philosophers 

response did hit a familiar note for me 

though while i am a spiritual person and 

do not believe that humans are the high
est intelligence out there its some of the 

morals and rules set forth by these bigger 

religions that i just cant get behind at 

of course doesnt mean that anybody who 

does follow those religions is wrong
although my beliefs and the beliefs of 
many of my friends werent changed by this 

event we all still came out having learned 

at the very least a little bit more about 

ourselves we learned what it would take for 

the beliefs most vital to our moral construct 

to be smashed and rebuilt by a whole new 

architect

loss of carnegie 
status a blow
buying textbooks the smart way
in the nov 4 issue i wrote 
an article detailing the 
need for more tenuretrack 
professors at msu and for 
an increased 
focus on 

research
  these issues 

are mutually 
inextricable and 
vital to the 
student com
munity a lack 
of commitment from the university 
to the research growth of principle 
investigators or to the careers of ad
juncts trickles down to substandard 

education for students
at the beginning of the year 
news broke about the loss of msus 

carnegie foundation ruvh 
status when i interviewed profes

sors in november this issue was 
vital the faculty senate consid
ered maintaining ruvh status as 

more important than faculty pay 
at msu  which is 80 percent of 
the national average for faculty pay 
president waded cruzado wrote 
in a letter to students and faculty 
it appears that doctoral awards 
are a key driving factor in our re
classification to address this she 
has implemented task forces to im
prove graduate student admissions 

strengthen research and reevaluate 
faculty workloads this is laudable 
but it is late it should not have 
taken loss of carnegie classification 
to trigger this sort of response the 
faculty senate has been demanding 
action for years but only now is 
anything being done
msu should not merely try to 
meet regional standards  arguably 
we do not  but strive to surpass 
them it is easier to maintain a 
position than regain one unfortu
nately well now have to claw our 

way back
college students oen complain about 
how expensive their education is  
they go on and on for hours about all the 
dierent bills they have to pay with all the 
money they do not have high on every 
college students complaint list 

is textbooks every semester 

students talk about how stress
ful buying textbooks for their 
classes is due to how extremely 

and unnecessarily overpriced 

most university bookstores are 

aer paying thousands upon 
thousands of dollars just to at
tend school why are universities 
forcing their students to buy textbooks for 

hundreds of dollars per book especially 

when most of the time students need these 
textbooks to do well in their classes
the good news is that now there are 
ways to bypass the university bookstore 
and get textbooks for a cheap and reason
able price a variety of different websites 

provide students the opportunity to 

get textbooks for cheaper 
amazoncom
 is a fairly well known website for get
ting brand name products significantly 

cheaper than you would at the brands 
store and the same is true for textbooks 
while it is true that not all textbooks 
are available online many of 

the more expensive general 
textbooks such as math phys
ics chemistry etc can be found 

on websites like amazon but 

even amazon sometimes can 

get a little pricey so if thats 
the case then you can also use 
thriftbookscom
 thriftbooks 
is exactly what it sounds like 
a website where one can find and buy 

for extremely cheap over seven million 
books and authors including textbooks 
plus on thriftbooks most if not all of 

their textbooks are under 30 which is a 

serious bargain another awesome thing 

about thriftbooks is that once you exceed 
10 on your order shipping is free and 
last time i checked college students are 

all about that free life
next time some college student says 
i am going to be crying myself to sleep 
tonight thinking about the 500 i am 

going to be spending on my textbooks 
tomorrow you can tell them that hisher 
despair is unnecessary because there are 

ways to get textbooks for an affordable 

price 
amazoncom 
is one way to get your 
textbooks for significantly less than at the 

universitys bookstore but if youre look
ing to get textbooks for pennies on the 

dollar definitely check out thriftbooks

com and then be sure to recommend them 

to your other broke college friends as well

  9combatting assault 
eres an app for at
more and more measures are being put 
into place to deter sexual assault on 
campuses nationwide as one in five women 
are affected throughout their college years 
such measures are now taking 

place in the form of smartphone 
apps most popular among young 
women personal safety apps 

are a trend born out of both fear 

and necessity though a smart
phone app is not likely to pre
vent an incident from occurring 
the apps have benefits otherwise 
in providing a sense of security 

alleviating fears and assisting first respond
ers in reacting to emergencies
safetrek is a studentcreated personal 
safety app safetrek contacts local law 

enforcement when its user fails to keep 
physical contact with their smartphone 
the program works like a mobile blue 
emergency phone pole the user holds a 
sensor on the phones screen while they 
walk to their destination when 

the sensor is released the pro
gram asks for a passcode that 
if not answered correctly will 
contact law enforcement provid
ing the users location based on 
the phones gps services
though some feel apps like 
safetrek perpetuate fear the 
aim and ultimate effect of these 
apps is to relieve anxiety rather than carry 

a canister of pepper spray smartphone 

owners can find solace in the device that 

rarely leaves their hands right well yes 

and no personal safety apps work great 
for those who have experienced trauma 
and find themselves under stress when out 

alone through their phones 

they are able to find relief from 

anxiety however strang
ers jumping from bushes is 
not as frequent a situation as 
popular culture may lead one 

to believe according to the 

department of justice only 18 

percent of rapes are committed 
by strangers 
in fact it may be best for 
everyone to look elsewhere 
some reviewers claim there are 

technological limitations that 

lead to a false sense of security 

with personal safety apps the 

main concern is in location 

services these apps rely on 

the builtin gps features of smartphones 
which as anyone using google maps or 
some similar program knows can be quite 
finicky all those places lacking service 

parking garages anywhere underground 
underwater downtown areas 

with a multitude of buildings 

etc are lacking the only thing 

that makes the apps worth
while location data 
though one cannot doubt 
the feeling of safety that ac

companies these apps as well 

as the premise is undoubtedly 
a move in the right direction 
for deterring assault it would 
be worth considering whether 
the developers are working 

toward prevention or feed
ing off the fears of certain 

demographics most personal 

safety apps come at a price and 

require friends and family also 
download the service safetrek is a free 
app but charges 3month inapp for ac
cess to services

deadpool
 everyones favorite foulmouthed hypersarcastic mercenary has nally gotten his own movie and 
early screenings have received rave reviews from fans but keep the kids away from this superhero movie  

deadpool has enough swearing and gore to make even the grownups gasp a little in theaters february 12

 
zoolander 2
 derek zoolander and crew return for a sequel 15 years in the making is time around 
zoolanders success is threatened by a rival modeling company will he  and the rest of the allstar cast  be 

able thwart their competition in theaters february 12

 
pride and prejudice and zombies
 is movie was never supposed to be anything but a good time and 
though it doesnt quite deliver even on that the premise is silly enough to be entertaining at least some of the 

time so if you want to see a collection of intimidating women slaying zombies in victorian garb  all while 

keeping a familiar romance at its core  pride and prejudice and zombies is for you now playing
e original xcom game took me completely o guard im not typically the type of person who enjoys sitting down 

and playing a strategy game given that i dont have the patience to actually gure out how to succeed in them but during 

the steam winter sale where i know we all blow countless dollars i saw that xcom was ve dollars so i gured that 

it wouldnt hurt to try it out i was taken completely by surprise when i had a blast with it and found that it was one of 

my favorite games of the year 
fortunately for those with no plans for valentines day the muchanticipated sequel has just been released and it is even 
better than the rst in xcom 2 the aliens you fought so hard against in the rst game have taken over the earth and 

reign supreme over humanity while it looks like the aliens are being kind to the humans building cities that provide 

promise for humanity there is a much more sinister plot and the aliens intend to destroy all who dont agree with their 

ways 
xcom 2 brings back everything you loved about the rst game and adds to it my personal favorite was the ability to 
customize your crew to a much greater extent than you could in the original rough the new customization system 

i was able to make all of my characters look like famous politicians athletes or even my friends which gave me an even 

better reason to keep them alive or kill them
if you are alone on valentines day and are looking for some way to pass the time i would recommend indulging and 
buying xcom 2
have other single friends and arent in the mood for a movie how about reliving family game night with good friends 
while the classic board games are hard to beat  monopoly sorry and scrabble are some of my favorites  there are a ton of new ones to try out better known newcomers like cards against humanity 
uelf and settlers of catan are frequently funny and absolutely amazingly fun but lack that valentines day air not to mention the price tag can be hey catan goes for about 50 for example and 

the availability slim uelf isnt carried anywhere in bozeman so what should one play
two of my favorites are love letter and marriage material love letter is a relatively cheap card game 11 at rooks comics and games where two to four players try to nd out who exactly is sending 
love letters to the princess set in medieval times the game takes only about a half an hour to play and pits each player against one another in sneaky intrigue and tests everyones ability to blu marriage 

material on the other hand is very much for the antiromantics e goal is to avoid being in a serious relationship and hilarity of course ensues similar to love letter in form marriage material is also 

a card game best suited to two to ve players e tongueincheek cards may occasionally remind players of their own relationships but the cartoons on each card keep it lighthearted marriage material 

is about 16 at rooks making it an aordable commitment
one of the newcomers to the bozeman brewery scene outlaw brewing pulled out all the stops when it comes 

to atmosphere brews and allaround charm when you walk in you can see the replace adorned with photos 

of all the sta and owners that shows you how long they have been in the brew making business in the back

womens basketball continues to build on winning streak
by patrick allard
is past week saw the womens bas
ketball team face o against portland 
state and sacramento state on feb 

4 and feb 6 respectively although 

both contests ended in a montana 

state victory the wins werent easily 
obtained on paper montana state 
highly outranks both teams in overall 

record and individual statistics ie 

total rebounds takeaways etc e 

lady cats boast an impressive big sky 

conference record having won 10 out 
of 11 contests compared to portlands 
1 out of 8 and sacramentos 4 out of 6 

in theory montana state should have 

handled both teams with relative ease 

at didnt prove to be the case  

neither portland state or sacramento 

went out without a ght 
for the entire rst half against port
land state the ball was primarily found 

on the vikings defensive half montana 

state possessed the ball extremely well 

and shot 52 percent in the eld e 

bobcats took their largest lead of the 

half at 3919 on a layup by senior guard 
lindsay stockton at the 243 mark 
msu entered intermission with a 17 

point advantage outscoring portland 

state 41 to 24 senior forward jasmine 

hommes became the epitome of on 
re she opened the rst quarter con
necting on eightofeight from the eld 
and nished with 23 total points 
e second half against portland 
state saw the cats team coordina
tion begin to deteriorate and their 
established lead jeopardized by 

careless possessions and poor shooting 
percentages for the game msu shot 
45 percent from the eld but was an 

icy 18 percent in the fourth quarter 

e cats once tight grip on the lead 

loosened almost to the point of their 

lead dropping down into the single 
digits fortunately the bobcats were 
tenacious enough to win the battle 

of the boards outrebounding the 

vikings 4737 and giving the cats 

their much deserved victory 
last saturday the cats went head
tohead with sacramento state for 

their second game of the week e 
hornets came out hungry for a win 
and would prove themselves a worthy 

adversary letting their performance 

overshadow their 714 overall record 

e women had to play without 

stockton her due to hsustaining a 
concussion from ursdays game 
against portland despite losing a key 

playmaker the bobcats committed 

just 12 turnovers against sacramento 

states frenetic full court press that fea
tured waveaerwave of substitutions 
e cats went into the locker room 

trailing only by two with the score 50

52 sacremento in the lead montana 

accurately outshot the hornets in 

the rst posting a solid 66 shooting 

percentage in the eld compared to 
sacramento states 33 percent regard
less of their poor shooting percentage 

the hornets rst half lead could be at
tributed to their aggressive board play 

severely outrebounding the cats 
sacramento state beat us on the 
boards in the rst half and that was 
one of the keys to the game for us 
msu head coach tricia binford 
said we gave up 15 oensive boards 
and thats giving them way too 
many second and third chances we 

addressed that at halime and did a 

much better job being the aggressor 

under the boards e battle of the 

boards became the cats key focus 

for the rest of the game e cats 

managed to end the game with a slight 

rebounding advantage 4543 is 

advantage gave the cats more posses

sion time allowing for more shots that 

resulted in the 11699 win

  13bobcat mens basketball fall 
to vikings take down hornets
by ian breuner
e bobcats had a tough week of conference 
away games taking on the vikings of portland 
state on feb 4 before traveling to sacramento 

california to battle the sacramento state 

hornets
msu traveled to portland and lost to a hot
shooting psu team 8368 e bobcats got 

out to a quick start leading 104 in under six 

minutes of play e vikings slowly crept back 

however and tied the game at 18 apiece with 

849 le in the rst half portland state nailed 

14 of their last 20 shots in the rst half taking 

control of the lead e vikings expanded that 

lead to seven at the intermission leading 3831 
psu continued their shooting streak well 
into the second half making 16 of their rst 21 

shots and taking a 14 point lead at the 1207 

mark e vikings took their largest lead of the 

game with 414 le in the game leading 8362 

e bobcats nished out the game with a 60 

run but were unable to overcome the vikings 

lead we just didnt make enough shots 

bobcat head coach brian fish said we never 

got in a good rhythm e bobcats were led 

in scoring by sophomore zach green who 

scored 17 points senior marcus colbert also 

contributed 13 points and ve assists for the 

bobcats e key to winning on the road is to 

get stops and make shots fish said we gave 
them a lot of easy shots they scored 46 points 

in the paint and that says that we were letting 

them get to their spots
e bobcats travelled to the capitol of cali
fornia to take down the sac state hornets e 

cats jumped out ahead early establishing a 124 

lead in just under four minutes of play with 

eight minutes le in the rst half the bobcats 

established a double digit lead but the hornets 

fought back and at the end of the rst half the 

cats only led by four 3834 msu started o 

the second half with a 60 run and quickly re

established a doubledigit lead  while sac state 

managed to cut the lead to one the bobcats 

held on to defeat the hornets 7976 fish 

credits every one of the 11 bobcat players for the 

victory i could name something that every guy 

did said fish one through 11 they all talked 

they all brought it freshman tyler hall led the 

cats in scoring notching 25 points and break

breaking the ice winter camping at canyon ferry
neck deep in the tetons
by nick kasser
it wasnt nearly as cold as i thought it would 
be my breath made steam but i was comfort
ably warm sitting by the re in nothing but 
a vest e ames crackled and snapped and 

danced in the night air throwing shadows 

on the ground by my chair coyotes howled 

across the lake e moon was out but clouds 

covered the stars once my re died down i 

crawled into my sleeping bag and slept until 

the dark hours of the morning 
when youre camping in the winter there is 
a great deal to consider obviously your biggest 

concern is hypothermia and frostbite in harsh 

montana winters you can get frostbite or go 

hypothermic in the middle of the day if youre 

not careful you have to have food and water 

at may sound redundant but anyone who 

camps regularly will tell you that its surpris

ingly easy to forget a water sack especially if 

youre prepping for a multi day shing trip 

and youre worried about remembering your 

rod lure sleeping bag tent etc but camping 

even in the winter is incredibly fun ere are 

lots of things i enjoy about camping rst and 

foremost being that for me camping always 

means shing i love being able to relax and sit 

by the re no cell phone ringing homework 

complete or forgotten for the moment ere 

is nothing like watching the stars but what 

i love most is the self reliance it forces you to 

have we live in the information age a day 
and time where just about any question can 

be answered with a book a cell phone or the 
internet when was the last time you had noth
ing but your own wits and a sharp knife to rely 
on when was the last time you had to solve a 

problem without the help of the internet 
i am wide awake at three in the morning 
and since i cant go back to sleep i break camp 

and get ready to go shing i sh on 11 inches 

of ice for ve hours and catch nothing despite 

all the research all the planning to sh this spot 

that ive done over the internet and with my 

depth map app it has not produced but there 
is a perfect sunrise is drives me to action 

and i decide its time to move on for greener 
pastures its still dark and cold as i drive the dirt 
road up the banks of the river im on my way 

up to a spot ive never shed before a bend in 

the river where the current grows sluggish and 

slack big sh hide here feeding on the craysh 

and sculpins and bugs that come thrashing 

downriver on the way i see a nice section of 

slackwater right aer two huge rocks its been a 

long morning and i dont have much time le 

before i have to head home but something tells 

me i need to sh this spot call it a gut feeling 
but i just know theres sh there so i get out 

of the car and clamber down the steep snowy 
banks of the river easing my way over slippery 
icecovered rocks and bushes
a few casts in and i catch a threepound rain
bow and by this point it is time to return home 

aer ve hours with no sh and being awake 

since three in the morning coming home to 

lunch and a hot shower doesnt sound like a bad 

idea and i am not coming back empty handed 

sometimes you have to forget all the technolo
gy and all the prep and the apps and everything 

else and just simply trust yourself

it looked like conditions were going to be 
alltime great jackson hole was reporting 17 
inches of new snow in the past 24 hours on 
top of the two feet that had fallen in the days 
prior it was still dark when we rolled into 

teton village at 7 am but the resort was 
already bustling e line for rst tram was 
well underway and we quickly hopped into 
the queue of hungry powder hounds ere 
was a two hour wait ahead of us before the lis 

would spin but nobody seemed to mind in 
fact with the sound of each avalanche bomb 
resonating through the valley the vigor among 
the crowd of skiers gathered on the tram deck 

magnied more and more the anticipation 

bubbling through the crowd was palpable it 

was almost as palpable as the tension that had 

dened our drive to jackson the night before 
we got a late start on our drive it was 630 
pm when we ocially departed bozeman 

and given the prevailing weather conditions 

ie snowy as all heck we werent expect
ing to arrive in jackson wyoming until way 

aer midnight we had been on the road for 

several hours by the time we passed ashton 

idaho ats about where it appeared the 
plows gave up judging by the six inches of 
fresh snow on the road and the ten inch 
dris it had been hours since any attempt 
had been made to clear the roadway 
ere wasnt much we could do but press 
on mile by mile through the tireless snow 

we forged ahead through driggs and victor 

up over the gauntlet of teton pass and even
tually to the last of the old west jackson 

hole e harrowing drive weighed fresh on 

our minds as we patiently waited for opening 

bell however our contemplation was broken 

by a giddy excitement sweeping through the 

li line e mornings rst tram was com
mencing to load 
we were among the fortunate few to make 
the rst public tram that morning and with 

it came a feeling of vindication e vexing 

drive of the night before and the ve hours 

of sleep had not been for naught for now 
we had the ne privilege of being stacked 
into the big red tram box like sardines a 
few minutes and 4000 vertical feet later we 
reached the summit of a snowy rendezvous 

mountain e tram box erupted in cheers
we skied down to the alta chutes in waist 
deep blower nding even deeper snow in the 

chutes themselves ough the mornings 

rst run didnt even turn out to be the days 

deepest it was our last run that made the day 

truly memorable an outofbounds zone 

just past the resorts southern edge served up 

the deepest snow my partner and i had ever 

skied aer a short hike we dropped down 

into a glade of windswept whitebark pines 

that harbored absolutely bottomless snow 

e snow was quite literally chest deep 

when we got to the bottom i knew that i 

had just skied something special it was truly 

a day to remember in jackson hole

e stage wasnt set e seats werent 
taken only one actor was in his place 
but such is how it goes during an average 
rehearsal and montana shakespeare in the 
parks production of my fair lady is no 

dierent actor je meyer spent the hour 

repeatedly belting out his solo on the 

street where you live while his director 

listened with complete undivided attention 

upon completion of each rendition the 

sudden silence was punctuated by meyers 

own selfdeprecating laughter in anticipa
tion of director kevin asselins comments
howd you feel about that one asselin 
asked meyer
maybe towering should be empower
ing meyer said referring to a word from 

the song and overpowering should be  

ah whats the word  sobering
he performed the song again editing his 
emotional performance accordingly when 

he hit the word towering meyer  em
bodying the role of freddy eynsfordhill  

sailed across the stage condent in his love 

for eliza doolittle when overpowering 

arrived only a few moments later his atti

tude shied downwards adding yet another 

layer to meyers performance
critiquing two words might seem like nit
picking but good actors know its all part 

of the process of creating a deep character 

and rich performance is production of 

my fair lady features four professional 

nonlocal actors  two of whom are from 

new york one who is a part of the oregon 

shakespeare festival and meyer who is from 

chicago  in addition to a collection of 

actors from the bozeman community e 

goal was to bring in working professional 

talent and integrate them with our com
munity and university talent in the hopes of 

creating a unique education experience for 

everybody said asselin the director of my 

fair lady and executive artistic director of 

montana shakespeare in the parks
my fair lady tells the story of henry 
higgins a professor who specializes in 
language and grammar and eliza doolittle 
a cockney ower girl aer elizas dreadful 
speech horries higgins he makes the claim 

that he could x her speech and turn her 

into a proper lady with just a few months 
of lessons much to higgins surprise eliza 
takes him up on his oer my fair lady is 
a musical based on the play pygmalion by 
george bernard shaw and performing it in 

the black box eatre has presented unique 
diculties that asselin has fully embraced
i was intrigued by the challenge of taking 
such a huge musical and making it work in 
such a small space and i think its coming 

together pretty well asselin said a lot 
of shaws material works incredibly well 
in intimate spaces because of the nature of 
relationship and 3dimensional characters 
that are remarkably draed similar to 

shakespeare  what you have is basically 

pygmalion lied on the page and put on to 
my fair lady
a typical production of my fair lady 
features a variety of location changes and 
anyone familiar with the small intimate 
stage at the black box eatre can see why 
shiing between a study a garden a ball and 
a horse race would be problematic but as
selin worked with a set designer a lighting 

designer and a costume designer to create a 

universal concept in terms of location that 

is somewhat exible and gives the audience 
not a literal translation of space but rather 

entices the audience to visually come up 

with their own idea of what the space may 
look like
e size of the theatre has truly energized 
the production since it creates a level of 
intimacy with spectators that most stage 

productions lack e black box is an 
amazing theatre that brings story into the 
laps of our audience asselin said
is production of my fair lady veers 
from other productions in several other 

key ways as well including its music e 

music was rearranged by the productions 
music director  who hails from chicago 
 to accommodate the black box space 
instead of a massive sweeping orchestra 
this production of my fair lady features 
a sixpiece chamber orchestra composed of 
msu faculty and members of the bozeman 
community none of the singers are using 
microphones but theyve managed to nd 

an excellent balance with the orchestra so 

neither is drowning out the other
e music for a lot of the singers has a 
very spoken quality to it that i think will 
work incredibly well with our audience mem
bers in this space asselin added
my fair lady marks the second col
laboration between montana shakespeare 

in the parks and intermountain opera the 

rst being last februarys production of e 

man of la mancha e goal of that initial 

collaboration according to asselin was to 

produce a musical at the highest production 

value they could oer aer the success of 

e man of la mancha everyone involved 

was eager to recreate the experience of put
ting a grand musical into such an intimate 

setting and thats how my fair lady came

hooking up has been part of college 
culture for a long while  probably at least 
since colleges became coed with hooking 

up comes getting turned down for some 

this fear of rejection is only second to a 

grizzly bear attack and showing up naked 

for a test that you didnt study for when it 

comes to college phobias others look at it 

from another perspective e one yes out 

of a dozen nos is the only one that counts 

today were going to start o with the basics 

before we get down and dirty were going to 

talk about how to get rejected respectfully 

and how to reject someone respectfully
valentines day is just around the corner 
see the centerfold for solo ways to spend 

sunday and that means desperation day is 

even closer luckily youll have both friday 

and saturday to try and convince someone 
or anyone that the best way to spend their 

day might be in the sheets with you maybe 

youll get lucky and that pickup line you 

saw work in a movie will work for you too 

but more likely unless youre really really 

ridiculously good looking there will be sh 

that dont bite 
what should you do when somebody 
doesnt want to know if thats a roll of quar
ters in your pants or not lets have a quick 

pop quiz
a call them a mean name

b say you were only joking anyway

c say okay and leave them alone

d wet your pants and not in the good 
            way
in this quiz much like many other 
multiple choice tests the correct answer is 

c while you may feel hurt inside dont let 

rejection get you down its perfectly okay to 

tell that guy in your math 

class that you want to take 

a mustache ride or tell the 

girl at the bar that you 

like her eyes when thats 

denitely not where you 

were staring what is a lot 

less okay is to put them 

down when they reject you 

inevitably i might add 

because both those lines 

are terrible no means 

no it doesnt mean keep 

trying it doesnt give you 

a license to be rude but it 

also doesnt mean its the 

end of your world so just 

take it in stride assure 

yourself that theyre the one missing out and 

move on to other maybe more receptive sh 

in the sea
its perfectly okay to want to sleep with 
someone you cant control who you nd 

attractive and you cant control whos still 
hanging around at last 

call what you can control 

this desperation day is 

how you handle your
self when trying to nd 

interested partners is 

goes both ways though if 

someone does hit on you 

or asks if youve got plans 

for the night  unless 

theyre extremely rude  

theres no good reason to 

not graciously take it as 

a compliment and gently 

turn them down just 

dont make it weird or a 

big deal on both ends 

college is about nding 
out who you are and what youre into so 

dont get hung up on the one that got away 

this valentines day
maybe youll get 
lucky and that 
pickup line you saw 
work in a movie 
will work for you 
too 
but more likely 
unless youre really 
really ridiculously 
good looking there 
will be sh that 
dont bite

l  callandmarkswelcome to earth a look back at our science fiction 
independence day
by rolf tengdin
independence day is turning 20 
this year and with the sequel coming 
this june it may seem easy to gloss 
over the original lm as a dumb 
action movie with no substance and 
for the most part that would be right 
what needs to be taken into account 
however is what the lm did for the 
movie industry as a whole and to un
derstand that we need to look back 
back in 1977 star wars had just 
nished the original trilogy and le 

a rather massive death star shaped 
hole in our hearts it was one of the 

most successful things to happen 
to cinema in the sci sphere since 
2001 a space odyssey for years 
aer the titan of sci le us hol
lywood was horried at the prospect 

of tackling another spaceshipshaped 
genre lm ere were the occa
sional lms of lesser signicance but 

anything truly sci related had the 
unfortunate label of bmovie most 
of these bmovie alienbased sci 
pictures t into the horror genre  
see alien or e ing  and 
for a while it seemed that all alien 
movies were good for were scaring 
people about space travel or the 
future of technology studios were 
terried to touch the little green men 

angle without giving it a semi horror 
spin but that all changed when 
1996s independence day came 
around 
e plot of independence day 
is a relatively simple one to remem
ber e long and short of it is that a 

small number of somewhat unrelated 
plots come together to defeat the evil 
alien invaders that destroyed nearly 
all of humanitys major cities with 
massive spaceships e humans use 
stolen technology and overthetop 
one liners to defeat them on the 
fourth of july thus giving us the 
lms title its cheesy its over the 
top and most importantly it is really 
funny 
what makes the lm relevant 
today however is that aer it became 
a box oce smash it opened the 

oodgates for studios to realize 
that maybe it is possible for them 
to make a alien movie that is a fun 
action romp independence day 
had seemingly recaptured the zany 
fun of the star wars lms  so why 
couldnt any others without inde
pendence day we probably would 

not have guardians of the galaxy

   19dessert that is 
 better than sex
by isabel loos
forget love lets be honest here the best 
part of valentines day is the chocolates 
heartshaped cookies and desserts made to 

impress in my mind quality treats are a way 
better valentines gi than cards jewelry or 
a giant stued bear i can say that if someone 
showed up at my house with a plate of these 
oreo trues i would be their valentine in 
a heartbeat ey are perfect to make to take 
to a valentines party to share with friends 
wrap up and give as a gi to your signicant 
other or scarf down with some milk and a 

good movie if you are spending valentines 

day alone
e problem with dessert recipes though is 
that usually they are extremely complicated 
expensive and time consuming if you are like 
me you are no chef and dont want to spend 

lots of money or time in the kitchen making 
something luckily i have the perfect solu
tion to this dilemma ese awardwinning 

trues are great because they are super fast 
and easy but look deceptively fancy ey 

are so delicious they might be the thing that 
scores you a date this year
 ingredients
 1 package of regular oreos 36 cookies
8 oz cream cheese
baking chocolate or candy melts for 
         dipping
 sprinkles

 directions
1 crush the whole package of oreos into 
a bowl you can crumble them with your 
hands use a blender or food processor or 

put them in a ziplock bag and throw them 
against the wall until they are broken into 
ne pieces
2 mix in the cream cheese is is a little 
easier if you take it out of the fridge before
hand and let it soen up a bit is step 
isnt quite as fun as the smashing but still 
rewarding because again you can use your 

very clean freshly washed hands to squish 
it around or a spoon if you want to be more 
civil it will feel a bit like playdough when it 
is all mixed together
3 shape the mixture into balls or any 
shape you want wink wink nudge nudge 
balls are just the easiest to dip place them 

on waxed paper and then freeze them for 
1015 minutes if you dont you are going 
to end up with lumpy balls  and nobody 
likes those
4 while the trues are freezing micro
wave your candy melts or baking chocolate in 

a microwave safe bowl for about 30 seconds 
stir then microwave for another 30 seconds 
and repeat until they are smooth
5 one at a time carefully drop the oreo 
trues into your melted dipping material of 
choice  make sure they are completely cov
ered en use two forks to remove them from 
the bowl easily and place them back on their 
waxed paper or on a plate if you are going to 
serve them immediately before they harden 
put some sprinkles on top if you so desire
6 finally stu your face to get rid of those 
valentines feels or share the love with your 
friends or signicant other ey are best the 
day they are made but can be refrigerated or 
frozen as well

msu professor neil cornish discusses gravitational wave detection research
by julie donagan
on sept 14 2015 an international team of 
scientists detected gravitational waves opening a 
new realm of study in astrophysics is was the 
rst time that gravitational waves were empiri
cally detected 100 years aer albert einstein 
predicted their existence msu physicist neil 
cornish was one of the members of this elite 
team of researchers
cornish has been a professor at msu since 
august 1999 he previously worked in the eld 

of theoretical cosmology both at cambridge as 
part of stephen hawkings research group and 
also at princeton on a nasa project to map 
aerglow of the big bang he became interested 

in changing his focus to gravitational waves be
cause of all the possibilities the eld oered its 

opening up an entire new way of looking at the 
universe the potential just seemed to be so great 
he said it was like wide open territory like going 
out to the west and there were all these opportu
nities where it hadnt all been picked over
msu is one of few universities with a 
program in extreme gravity which led cornish 
to montana ere arent that many places in 
the world that actually have a focus on studying 
gravitational astrophysics and extreme gravity he 
said e program was founded in the 1960s by 
ken nordtvedt who came to msu from mit 
and established a group focused on gravity and 
general relativity hiring new faculty in the eld 
in addition to its research opportunities 
bozemans landscape appealed to cornish he 

grew up on a farm in the foothills of the gram
pians in australia and he was happy to return to 

the mountains ere was a department with 
a research focus in what i worked in also in a 
beautiful mountain setting so it just seemed like 

the perfect t he said
in 2007 msu became the 42nd institution 
to join the laser interferometer gravitational
wave observatory ligo collaboration a 
project which uses highsensitivity detectors 
to search for gravitational waves e ligo 
project started in 1997 and began installing ad
vanced detectors in 2011 e new instruments 
began operation in 2015 
according to cornish collaboration on an 
international level is becoming increasingly 
common especially in the eld of astronomy 
to be able to go beyond what has been done 
previously in astronomy you typically need a 

bigger telescope more sensitive equipment 
and these facilities cost hundreds of millions to 
billions of dollars eyre not something that a 
single researcher is going to be doing cornish 
explained were denitely in the era of big 

science 
currently two msu researchers are working 
on the ligo project cornish and graduate 
student meg millhouse using a data analysis 
method developed by cornish and former 
msu graduate students tyson littenberg and 
paul baker weve developed a technique that 
allows us to detect any kind of gravitational wave 

signal with no assumptions about what it looks 
like cornish said other analysis methods use 
pattern matching making this method a unique 
way to search for gravitational wave signals in 
the trace plots produced by the ligo detectors 
which use lasers to track the distance between 
two mirrors by not making assumptions the 

the analysis program can pick up even unexpect
ed signals as signals have not been modeled for 
all cosmic events it opens up discovery space 
cornish said e teams work was featured in 

the rst gure of the gravitational waves discov
ery paper
in msus extreme gravity group there are 
three professors and eight graduate students doing 

research as well as some undergraduate students 
only cornish and millhouse are ocially 
members of the ligo collaboration but there 

are other research projects being done as well an
other one of cornishs projects is using pulsar tim
ing to detect gravitational waves is technique 
is meant to pick up lower frequency gravitational 
waves produced by larger cosmic events 
e department as a whole does not require 
many university resources as the research is 

mostly theoretical the department does not 
require laboratory space ey use msus 
supercomputer  hyalite cluster  for some 
of their analysis though most of the ligo 

data analysis takes place on national science 
foundationestablished supercomputers at 

caltech cornishs research is supported by 
three grants two from the national science 
foundation one for ligo and one for pulsar 
timing and one from nasa for the develop
ment of a future gravitational wave detector that 

would go in space according to cornish while 

extreme gravity research does not require a lot 
of university resources they would benet from 
greater supercomputer capabilities on campus
cornishs research extends into his teaching 
for undergraduate courses cornish teaches 

through the honors college including the 

introductory physics sequence and origins 

a seminar focusing on the origins of life and 
the universe when i teach in undergraduate 
physics i like to make connections to things 

that are going on in physics right now because 

balls rolling down inclined planes doesnt really 

generate much excitement he said addition
ally some of the analysis techniques used for 
gravitational waves are built into the nal project 
for an undergraduate course on computational 
methods i like to bring as much of the research 
into the teaching as possible cornish said
cornish was condent that gravitational 
waves would be detected by the new ligo 

instruments but not necessarily during the rst 

observing run i was a little surprised with just 
how quickly it all happened but i was essentially 
100 percent condent that the new instruments 

within the next couple years would make a 

detection he said he expects that within the 

next few years tens to hundreds of gravitational 

waves will be detected en we can really start 
to do some serious astrophysics you can do a fair 
amount with one event but you really start do
ing the astrophysics when you have hundreds

the announcement drew quite the crowd as students faculty and community members alike 
gathered in the procrastinator theater to hear cornish speak

msu professor wins 
career award
by 
ann rupert
an msu professor is conducting 
research which will potentially lead to 
new treatments for a disease that aects 50 

million americans e national science 
foundation awarded ron june phd an 
assistant professor of mechanical and in
dustrial engineering the career award 

a 500000 grant to further his work in 
osteoarthritis he aims to develop a drug 
to regenerate the cartilage tissue the disease 
aects which will require research that has 
never been done before
june obtained his undergraduate degree 
in engineering sciences at dartmouth 

college where he was involved in research 

measuring acceleration in the heads of foot
ball and hockey players in order to develop 
more eective helmets he moved on to 
graduate studies at university of califor
niadavis where a wide array of research 
in biomechanics furthered his interest in 
cartilage mechanics as did postdoctoral 
studies at the va hospital in san diego in 
a rheumatology lab he came to msu in 

2011 and began his research in osteoarthri
tis june was granted the career award 
this month which is a prestigious award 
given to a single junior faculty member 
who exemplies the role of a scholar and a 
researcher  
osteoarthritis occurs when the cartilage 
at the end of bones deteriorates oen 
aecting the knees hips spine and hands 

with the largest risk for the disease being 
age little can be done aer diagnosis e 
disease causes sti and painful joints as 
cartilage is unable to keep up with regular 
wear and tear is leads to a cycle of 
weight gain and worsened symptoms 
ere are no drugs currently available for 

treatment leaving joint replacements as a 
last option however many patients cannot 

undergo the procedures due to the risks 
and if eligible the surgeries are painful 

expensive and can only be done a limited 

number of times 
is is where june is directing his work 
i would love to give the opportunity to 
people to live the last decade of two of 
their lives in dramatically less pain and 
with greater function june said e goal 
of my research program is to come up with 
new ideas for drugs that can help to slow 
the onset of osteoarthritis he is look
ing to determine the energy metabolism 
in tissue cells and whether the cartilage 
is able to convert mechanical energy into 
biochemical energy ultimately this could 
lead to nding drugs to aid in cartilage 

regeneration
junes team consists of 12 msu research
ers he coordinates with many departments 

on campus as well in the bozeman com
munity and throughout the country due 

to a strong core in mass spectrometry and 

building of specialized equipment msu 

has a unique setup that has allowed for op
portunities that other universities are unable 
to provide graduate and undergraduate 
students from a wide variety of elds are 

allowed to develop their own projects that aid 

in the basic research needed to understand 

the complexities of the disease
additionally the msu and bozeman 
communities have been very collaborative 

in their eorts medical institutions in 

bozeman have provided the team with raw 
material procedures done at the hospital 
and other establishments provide tissues 

and joints to the research team that other
wise would have been thrown away 
if junes hypotheses are proven correct 
drugs may be developed to delay or stop 

the onset of osteoarthritis in the next few 

decades he attributes the success of his 

program thus far to the emphasis msu 
places on research not only enabling but 
requiring faculty to do research is some
thing msu in particular is farsighted on 

and in my opinion that will result in better 

experiences in the classroom june said 
a lot people try to separate research and 
teaching but i dont think you can ey 

need to be integrated and bringing cutting 

edge research into the classroom

studies insects bacteria abroad
by 
dave
 atkinson
most people do everything 
they can to avoid mosqui
toes ticks eas and other blood
sucking creatures and want nothing 
to do with any exotic amazonian 
bacteria but occasionally there 

comes an adventurous academic like 

msu professor ryan jones 
jones began working at msu in 2013 
as an assistant research professor in the 
department of land resources and 

environmental sciences i sort of became 
interested in microbiology by accident 
jones said his research was originally in 

the eld of biology studying parrots and 

songbirds he went on to attend graduate 

school where he learned how to generate 

and analyze dna sequence data prior to 

coming to msu he worked in a genetics 

lab at the university of colorado where 

he studied the bacterial communities 

living inside eas is eventually led 

jones to be considered a microbiologist 

due to his growing experience in the 

eld however he said i really consider 

myself an evolutionary geneticist  com
munity ecologist who happens to study 

microbes 
on a mission to see how the bacte
rial composition in insects reacts with 

diseasecausing pathogens in perus loreto 

region jones is headed to south america 

for a fourweek expedition supported by a 
18000 grant from the national geo
graphic society e loreto region covers 
the vast majority of perus amazon terri

tory jones hopes to return with anywhere 

between 5000 and 10000 samples of 
insects to ensure the research conducted 
represents a wide range of both geograph
ical locations and insect species follow
ing the collection of samples and selection 

of the group of samples to be researched 

highthroughput dna sequencing will be 
used to sequence the 50000 to 100000 
bacterial dna sequences to be found in 

each sample insect 
using this method jones and graduate 
student nick pinkham will analyze how 

the nonharmful bacteria living inside 

insects impacts their ability to spread 

diseases well be working to determine 

the eects of biogeography on microbial 
community composition and to assess 
the relationship between microbial com
munity composition with the presence of 
specic diseasecausing agents jones said 
if we see a disease thats prevalent in one 

area or another we might nd a correla
tion with bacteria that is present in the 

insect sample from that area for example 
other studies have shown that certain 
bacteria will limit the ability of mosqui

toes to spread dengue e research will 
ideally help in the prediction of where 
diseases are likely to spring up and spread 
in addition to his research trip jones 
will be taking students to the amazon for 
two weeks this summer as part of his sum
mer course on tropical diseases

e warming center provides shelter to bozemans homeless community
by dakotah
 whiting
its the dead of winter and a bozeman 
man is chilled to the bone from the biting 
december winds he yearns for a warm 

house and a steaming cup of hot cocoa but 

unfortunately has no place to call home 

instead he is forced to crawl into the back 

of an open uhaul truck to shield himself 

from the bitter cold slowly he freezes 

to death and his body is found the next 

morning 
this tragic story which occurred in 
bozeman during the winter of 2007 

prompted the human resource develop
ment council hrdc to open a seasonal 

shelter called the warming center this 

year is their sixth season in operation the 

center is open seven days a week from 7 

pm  7 am and is free for patrons the 

shelter provides comfortable sleeping 

arrangements as well as hot showers every
one in need is encouraged to stay trained 

professionals make sure every person is safe 

and comfortable we dedicate ourselves to 

getting everyone back on track to being a 

safe member of our community housing 

director sara savage said 
though the warming center would 
ideally stay open year round the major 

lack of funding makes it a struggle to keep 

the doors open even seasonally the center 

costs roughly 120000 a year to oper
ate that is 25 per person per night the 

center is funded entirely by community 

donations and when the cost of funding is 

not met the center has no choice but to 

close early the ability to keep our doors 

open is utterly dictated on funding each 

year savage said this winter the warm
ing center was excited to be able to open 

their doors earlier than usual on nov 1
the number of people without homes is 
an increasing problem throughout amer
ica though bozeman is progressing in 

the right direction there is still a lot to be 

done across the nation we are coming up 

with new ways to approach homelessness 

from sober living to transitional housing

ing as soon as possible it is important to 

understand that every challenge is differ
ent so there need to be different options 

for people these people are human 

beings hearing their story shows you just 

how unique each and every one of them 

are savage passionately expressed the 

warming center has seen over 170 guests 
since the beginning of november and they 

expect to see many more 
prior to the warming centers opening 
in response to the uhaul incident there 

were no resources available for bozemans 

homeless community the event woke up 

our community these are our neighbors 

we need to make sure our people are pro
tected savage said though the warm
ing center and other available resources 

such as the battered womans shelter and 

the family promise of gallatin valley are 

helpful assets to bozeman these alone will 

not end homelessness the most pressing 

issue in bozeman is the amount of time it 

is taking our neighbors to get into afford
able housing with so few units available 

and prices rising the struggle becomes 

difficult being homeless there are strikes 

against you making it much harder to com
pete for housing savage said 
after the warming center opened 
their doors in 2010 many msu students 

have used it as a resource according to 

the free application for federal student 

aid fafsa there are more than 58000 

homeless college students registered in the 

us if you are lost or confused this is a 

great place to start our staff are kind and 
empathetic we are here to listen and to 

help savage said other msu students 

can get involved by volunteering time is 

the best gift students can give volunteer
ing offers an incredible opportunity to un
derstand the face of homelessness and learn 

their stories not everyone has a long beard 

and a cardboard sign just like our commu

sizes homelessness is very isolating giving 

up your time to help means so much to our 

guests you give them a new sense of hope

zmsus college of engineering and south 
campus project recently received a large dona
tion from a wellknown construction mogul 
tim and mary barnard of barnard con
struction companies inc a bozeman based 

construction and engineering rm is pledging 

6 million to the college of engineering and 

the development of msus south campus 

e pledge has been divided with 5 million 

going to the south campus construction and 

1 million going exclusively to the college of 

engineering to be used at their discretion
e barnards although not alumni of 
msu have hired many msu students from 

the college of engineering according to traci 

weller senior director of development for the 

msu foundation mr barnards pledge is a 

way for him to pay back what the college has 

done for him and his business he understands 

the quality of students that msu produces 

of msus recent enrollment growth 46 per
cent  has been in the college of engineering
e remaining 5 million of the barnards 
pledge will go towards the construction of 

msus south campus which will be located 

across the street from the sub e project 

includes a parking complex and the norm 

asbjornson innovation center naic a 

state of the art learning facility geared toward 

breaking down the silos between colleges 

essentially closing the communication gaps 

between colleges and programs of campus

space where all colleges can come together 

and collaborate you may be majoring in 

engineering and may not necessarily have ever 

communicated with someone that is a political 

science major or a landscapedesign major 

and suddenly you are on a job and you realize 

there is more to constructing a building you 

may have to talk to a political science major to 

nish a certain building and you need to know 

how to communicate weller explained
e norm abjornson innovation center 
is a 70 million project and asbjornson has 

already pledged 50 million towards the con

e human immune system protects 
against harmful microorganisms on a daily 
basis and has the ability to produce millions 
of pathogenspecic immune cells mark 
jutila a bozeman native is head of msus 
department of microbiology and immunol
ogy and a major contributor to the body of 

knowledge on the immune system jutila 

delivered a lecture at the museum of the 

rockies on feb 16 as part of the provosts 

distinguished lecturer series
jutila graduated from msu in 1982 with 
a bachelors of science in microbiology he 

received a phd from washington state uni
versity and did a fellowship in the depart
ment of pathology at the stanford school of 
medicine in 1989 he returned to msu
jutila began his lecture by giving an 
overview of how the immune system works 

e body fends o a wide array of microor
ganisms on a daily basis many of which are 

highly pathogenic we have rather exquisite 

mechanisms to ght o viruses bacteria 
parasites and fungi jutila said
e immune system targets pathogens or 
microorganisms that can harm the body by 
targeting the molecules on pathogens called 

antigens one example of a mechanism used 

to target pathogens is that the body makes an
tibodies rough some really wild mecha
nism those antibodies will eliminate clear 

that pathogen from the body jutila said
jutila explained that this process almost 
always works and that the proportion of the 

time that the body cannot ght o the patho
gen and becomes ill is actually very small e 
antibodies the body makes last a long time 
which explains why once the body is exposed 

to a pathogen it can become immune jutila 

said the key point in this is that antibodies are 

highly specic ey target the molecules 

that are unique to the given pathogen
jutila then explained that the body is 
capable of creating a defense for an impressive 

number of pathogens we have the capacity 

to make millions and millions of dierent an
tigen receptors each dierent by the antigen 

that they recognize he said
e lymph nodes and tonsils are places 
where immune cells proliferate which ex
plains why sickness is oen accompanied by 

swollen lymph nodes and tonsils e body is 

creating more immune cells is is also why 

it takes a week to 10 days to get over things 

like a common cold e body has to have 

time to mount its defense jutila also pointed 

out that the body creates antibodies before 

birth
for the remainder of the lecture jutila 
discussed the work that came from his own 

studies he emphasized the role of students 

and colleagues in the progress he was able to 
be a part of and humbly expressed is is 
not me 
part of jutilas research has focused on 
gammadelta tcells which are a part of the 

bodys adaptive immune system response and 

the bodys immunity his research into the 

bodys inammatory response has helped in 

the development of treatments for disorders 

like psoriasis currently jutilas research fo
cuses on increasing the tracking of immune 

cells in the body

founders day proides time to reect on growth
msu may have turned 123 
years old on feb 16 but the 
university is looking younger and 
better than ever msu was originally 

founded in 1893 as montana state 

college of agriculture and 

mechanic arts 
  msu has grown a bit since the ini
tial enrollment of 46 students and 
with that growth it is important 

to ensure that msu is keeping the 
student experience in mind
each year it is increasingly 
evident that msu is straining to 
keep pace with the growth from strug
gling to nd rooms in residence halls for 
the freshmen to students spending twenty 
minutes looking for a parking space  the 

struggles are obvious msu is responding to 

the cramped campus with additional infra
structure albeit a little late but additions 

from the parking garage to the new resi
dence hall will provide certain areas on cam
pus much needed relief e parking garage 
provides a slight increase in parking spots 

as it will accommodate 550 cars 150 more 
than the previous parking lot provided jake 
jabs college of business and entrepreneur
ship created 11 new classrooms that accom
modates 440 students e norm 

asbjornson innovation center 
will provide additional classroom 
and laboratory spaces while the 
yellowstone residence hall will 
house 400 new freshmen 
e last two years have seen ex
ceptional struggles with residence 
halls at the beginning of the last 

academic year 89 students were 
placed in temporary housing e tempo
rary displacement undoubtedly had negative 

impacts on freshmens rst year experience 

 trying to soak in the college experience 

living in a dorm lounge with other students 

doesnt exactly scream ideal freshmen 

experience it also doesnt help when stu
dents go from their temporary housing to a 

cramped underequipped and overcrowded 

classroom 
although with the growth came expan
sion of several notable departments offices 

and positions the growth is apparent in 
the most subtle of ways 
 even in the sub  in 
2011 msu committed 
to opening a veteran 
support center creat
ing a welcoming space 
for veterans to connect 
with other veterans and 
resources including 
tutoring and counseling 

and to simply provide 

a space for veterans to 

call home on campus 

the diversity awareness 

office used to be a half

time position before the 

school provided funding 

to not only change the 

halftime position to 

a full time position but also provided an 

office space for diversity awareness on 

the third floor of the sub broadening the 

scope of student services however small 
they may seem is incredibly important 

for ensuring that msu does not lose its 

appeal and its student centered focus amid 
growth 
it would be an under
statement to say that 

the above changes are 
beneficial but it would 
also be misguided to say 
such changes are enough 
each new student comes 
to msu with a variety 
of needs and as a school 

msu should be doing 

all they can to ensure 

that all students have 

resources available to 

them  from increas

ing ada access across 

campus to creating a staff 

position for lgbtqia 

students  msu needs 
to continue increasing services with in
creasing enrollment numbers happy 123rd

shigher education has more to oer 
than just classes to prepare people for 
careers universities also oer classes that 

prepare you for life itself and make you a 

more wellrounded individual 

overall learning a foreign lan
guage is the most practical way to 

gain realworld knowledge in the 

classroom
ere are the obvious uses of 
learning a foreign language for 

instance if you plan on traveling 

or doing business in a foreign 

country knowing the native 

language will make life signi
cantly easier however knowing a foreign 

language serves a much greater purpose  on 

a personal level e fundamental act of 

learning a nonnative language forces you 

to reevaluate the world and perceive it 

through the eyes of someone else uirks of 

other languages such as gendered pronouns 
or words that dont have a direct equivalent 

in english serve as windows into another 

world in order to learn another language 

you have to learn another culture and 
in doing so youll expand your 

worldview 
becoming uent in a foreign 
language can be a long and dif
cult process but in the end its 

about more than just how to make 

sentences or read dierent kinds 

of characters you will come out 

with a better understanding of 

the english language e abil
ity to speak and communicate 
with others in our native language is oen 

something that develops relatively naturally 

over time and is thus very easily taken for 

granted foreign languages force you to 

look at the idea of language dierently and 

allow you to become more intentional with 

word choice in daily dialogue 
in this sense the value of learning another 
language cannot be properly quantied it 

is not as simple as the idea that this class 

will help me complete this degree to get this 

job while there are more job possibili
ties when you know a foreign language the 

overall value goes beyond what youre adding 

to your resume learning another language 

should be a natural part of higher education 

because it makes people more intelligent and 

wellrounded such that they can live better 

lives which is aer all one of the most 

important reasons to get an education in the 

rst place 
is is more in line with the idea of a 
liberal arts education which as david foster 

wallace put it gives you the choice of what 

to think about is way of thinking sums 

up both the practical and personal value of 

that kind of education and if that sounds 

at all appealing than learning a foreign lan
guage is a great rst step towards that msu 

currently oers courses in arabic french 

german japanese mandarin chinese and 

spanish any credits beyond 12 dont add to 

tuition costs and msu oers the option to 

audit classes meaning theyre not factored 

into gpa so i guess the only question 

regarding learning another language is why 

not
the value of learning a foreign language

goodbye football hello parking
digital society 
sheds virtual 
weight
tens of bobcat football fans are 
becoming concerned by the growing 
interest in replacing bobcat stadium with 

a massive parking complex in recent years 

msus football team has proved that in
creasing enrollment rates are not 

enough to beat the grizzlies 

so the administration is seeking 

to kill a half dozen birds with 

a truck full of concrete end 

the bobcatgrizzly rivalry and 

increase the universitys total 

revenue by replacing the bobcat 

football stadium with a parking 

structure that would make more 

money with four parking passes 

than bobcat football ticket sales grossed 

since 2010
representatives from msus sports 
facilities department have claimed that 

the new parking structure would keep the 

spirit of bobcat footballtailgatingalive 

while getting the redundant and expen
sive football game out of the picture e 

ncaa is fully endorsing this move by 

schools in lowertier conferences poten
tially saving them billions in the long run 

e ncaas contractual 15 percent prot 
from these new parking facilities only 

further motivated them to get behind the 

move
tailgaters have been especially in favor of 
this shi away from football and continue 
to push for parking reform tail
gate advocat rick von sloneker 

was quoted saying e halime 

no reentry policy is like really 

killing the mood von sloneker 

has hopes that the freedom of 

the parking garage will bring 

tailgating back to being pretty 

dope in his own words mon
tana hall refused to comment 

on this statement
according to nancial projections 
the monetary loss of the tens of bobcat 

football fans will net out aer the parking 

garage has been operational for approxi

mately 43 minutes admins are advising 

current msu football players to either 

switch to premed or transfer to the uni

versity of oregon e general consensus 

by the community is that this move away 

from attempted sports culture will overall 

benet both msu and the community of 

bozeman both nancially and socially
regardless of age gender or social status 

everyone is beset with selfdoubt 
concerning their personal appearance is 
selfdoubt motivates virtually everyone 

to enhance or alter their looks 

with distinct clothing jewelry 

makeup diets hairdos and so on 

ere is no end to the extent to 

which members of society will go 
in order to make themselves at
tractive similarly there is no end 
to the manners in which people 

will attempt to take advantage of 

others insecurities 
an app that nds itself enveloped by issues 
in body image is photo editor skineepix 

 designed to make people look up to 15 

pounds thinner e app works only with 

single headshot seles and claims to level 

the playing eld by removing the 15 pounds 

cameras supposedly add to a persons gure
ough it is intended to help its users feel 
better about themselves and their photos the 

app only adds to the societal pressures placed 

on appearance e american populace has 
habituated itself to an unbending standard of 
beauty preserved by magazines movies tele
vision and most other forms of media what 
is worse is that there is a specic demograph
ic being targeted young women 

most body image research shows 
that women are far more disap
proving and judgmental of their 

appearances than men ere is 
more value and judgment placed 
on the female beauty standard 
meaning young women have 
greater pressures to maintain an 
attractive appearance ese pres
sures combined with other factors can have 

severe consequences including mental health 
issues and eating disorders skinneepix is 
only contributing to the problem 
ere are claims that the app promotes 
an unhealthy body image that may motivate 
women to adopt unhealthy behaviors for 
young girls already insecure about their 
physical appearances as well as vulnerable to 
disorders apps like skinneepix could con
tribute to anorexic and bulimic behaviors

humble 
beginnings
ocially founded in 1955 bridger bowl 
recently celebrated its 61st anniversary as a 
bozeman landmark unique for its backcoun
try service its nonprot status and its small 

town vibe much has changed at bridger over 

these 61 years but much remains the same 

e truly dedicated locals began hunting out 

the cold smoke the mountain resort is known 

for in the 1940s before chairlis lodges and 

other amenities were even imagined with 

enough of a following the state of montana 

decided to purchase a 120 acre chunk of land 

and turned it into the bridger mountain state 

park its lone tow rope wasnt enough to hold 

the public interest however and the park 

struggled 
e mountain wasnt out of commission for 
long though as local skiers banded together 

and reorganized into what is now known as 

the bridger bowl association operating as 

a nonprot the association rst relied on 
volunteers in order to build the original lis 
e iconic red chair lis popped up in the 

mid1970s and can now be found on campus 

or around town e late 1980s and early 

1990s brought more rapid expansion in 

1988 the jim bridger lodge replaced the old 

base chalet and the deer park chalet at mid

mountain received a faceli in 1996 other 

renovations such as the stairway to the jim 
bridger lodge some snowmaking capacity 

the powder park quad li and another base 

lodge saddle peak opened to keep pace with 

evergrowing demand 
an everevolving 
landmark
on jan 17 of this year bridger experienced 
the busiest day in its lifetime over 5000 

people made the trip up the canyon to the ski 

hill a normal weekend with new snow usually 

attracts 3500 to 4000 people so the big jump 

came as a welcome surprise to bridger bowls 

general manager randy elliott hired to his 

current position in 2004 elliott has overseen 

a number of expansions and renovations to the 

oncesmall ski resort once a meager size the 

ski hill now boasts over 2000 acres of terrain 

its most recent expansion schlasmans li 

began operating in 2008 named aer a miner 

who died in a 1885 avalanche the expansion 

brought new accessible backcountry area to 

the bridger community 
we went a long time without doing much 
to lis until basically 1995 when we started 

replacing the old riblet lis that were built in 

the 1960s and 70s elliott remarked and 

that only happened because bozeman grew 

and we were able to get out of debt and with 

the growth of bozeman and the increase in 

skier trac which has led to even more trac 

its kind of like what youve seen with msu 
and its really blown up quite a bit since the 

80s and 90s
e expansion of the physical boundaries 
also accompanies an expansion of the clientele 

at the resort at one point only technically 

advanced skiers could tackle the wide array of 

skiing the mountain oers at is no longer 

the case with the new equipment now 

everyones a powder skier elliott continued 

it used to be that back in the 70s and 80s 

you used to have a certain number of folks 
who would come because it was much more 
dicult to ski powder and others who would 

only seek the groomed runs 
but more than just the capabilities and 
types of skiers has grown anks to the 

modern upgrades relative aordability of the 

hill about half the price of nearby big sky ski 

resort and accessibility and popularity of the 

surrounding area bridger sees more skiers 

from across the globe than ever before elliott 

would know better than anyone  he has 

been with bridger bowl since 1977 starting as 

part of the ski patrol    
ere are denitely more people traveling 
to get here with the growth of the airport 

its easier to get here than ever it used to be 

pretty much just drive trac and now we see 

more people y in on the direct ights rent a 

car and hotel in bozeman and ski bridger its 
a pretty economical option compared to ying 

in to some of the bigger resorts 
capturing the cold 
smoke
while the resort has certainly moved past 
its humble beginnings as a local momandpop 

operation the cooperative spirit stays rm 

even in the explosion of the bozeman area 
what changes might be in store for the moun
tain in the next decade e bradley meadows 
area is one future expansion spot toward the 

north but likely not until the inbounds area 

is lled in more bridger operates on a lease 

from the forest service so expansion is a 

much more complicated process than it may 

be for other areas but with prots reinvested 

into the mountain rest assured that no matter 

how much changes at bridger bowl certain 

things will stay the same 
i think most everybody would say the roots 
are still there elliott concluded everything 

evolves in time but i think that people really 

take pride in being the local area and a lot of 

people have been skiing this area for a long 

long time and that avor hasnt changed too

contests on the road this past week 

that resulted in backtoback wins 

giving the cats its 19th win of the 

season and their 12th overall big 

sky conference win is records 

gives the cats top standing in the 

conference over teams like eastern 

washington 112 and idaho 10

3 ese wins have great signi

cance elsewhere as they mark msu 

head coach tricia binfords 100th 

big sky conference win since her 

coaching debut 11 years ago 
e bobcats rode down to 
flagsta arizona to face nau 

for their rst game of the week 

despite naus weak record 6

17 210 their aggressive board 

play gave the cats a run for their 

money points in the paint total 

rebounds and eld goal percent
age were all nearly tied every type 

of play of the game was tight and 

if werent for  msus 133 nal 

run the cats wouldnt have been 

able to break away from nau in 

the middle of the fourth quarter 

e game featured eight ties and 

ve lead changes most of these 

occurring in the third period 
senior forward jasmine hommes

well e win coupled with north 

dakotas 7269 victory over east
ern washington put the bobcats 

in sole possession of the top spot in 

the big sky conference 
it was a tough game to get into 
any kind of a ow binford said it 

was hard to establish a tempo but 

im proud of the kids and their re
siliency everyone steppedup and 

just made plays to nish the game 

against a really tough opponent
aer ursdays nail biter 
against nau the cats headed 

back up to utah to face the 

southern utah underbirds 

e rst quarter saw the cats 

fail to establish any ow in the 

oense much in part due to sus 

tenacious crashing defense e 

underbirds severely out
rebounded the cats 3950 but 

this is coupled with allowing 12 

takeaways overshadowing their 

dominant board performance and 

giving the cats more possession 
time southern utah was crashing 

all over and we had no answer for 

them on the glass binford said 

give southern utah credit they 

played hard and hit shots it was a 

tough rst half 
in the second half the cats were 
able to get a grip on the oense 

shooting 44 percent in the eld 

e cats began to break away and 

never looked back never forfeiting

winter rock climbing destinations for the cabin crazed climbing crusher
by parker webb
regardless of the climbing style  be it 
trad bouldering or sport climbing  we all 
are itching to get out on the rocks luckily 

within close distances to bozeman there are 

options for all climbing types to get out and 

crush this winter for directions to all of the 

crags and more information on the climbs 

there check out mountain project to maxi

mize your fun for winter climbing remember 

to layer up and study up on what the weather 

is supposed to do for the day youll be out
 sport climbing allenspur
for those looking to clip bolts and whip 
big the best option for winter rock climb
ing would be allenspur located in paradise 

valley and roughly 30 miles from campus 

allenspur gets aernoon sun which helps 

keep temps warm enough to climb please do 

all southwest montana climbers a favor and 

read about the access issues for allenspur and 

practice good crag etiquette  the owners of 
the land below allenspur are very generous 

to allow people to climb there and the ability 

to go there can be taken away at any time 

with climbs mainly in the 59  511 range 

it is perfect for the moderate sport climber 

looking to whip hard and have fun in the sun 

while denitely not warm all the time track
ing weather windows can add to the enjoy
ment and allow you to feel your ngers while 

crimping down e mustdo route is flake 

fest a 510b climb located on the 711 crag 

starting up a slight corner leads into big jugs 

on a slightly overhanging wall a sixtymeter 

rope with twelve quickdraws will work for 

most climbs bring a rope tarp and leave the 

dog at home
 trad climbing king and queen 

spires pipestone
while not the closest option for trad 
climbing near bozeman the king and ueen 

spires located near pipestone and delmoe 

lakes are denitely the greatest choice for trad 

climbing in the winter normally holding 
warmer temperatures and milder weather 

than the gallatin canyon these spires 

oer quite a variety of climbs e ueen 

holds shorter routes many of which can be 

top roped and a mixture of trad and sport 

routes with climbs from 56 up to hard 

512 anyone can nd good climbs in these 

spires a great beginner trad lead is begin
ners lead a moderate gear eating crack a 

classic for the ueen is cruise control an 

overhanging hand crack rated at 510b both 

of these routes tend to get their fair share of 

sun perfect for winter weather e king 

oers longer lines including a few multipitch 

routes a single rack will work for most ob
jectives however a double rack to a number 

3 camalot would be ideal with a 4 and 5 as 

well when you get bored of the roped climb
ing there is a multitude of bouldering nearby 

as well a 4wd car is a must unless you want 

to walk further as it is an oroad atv trail 

to get to the main parking area subaru out
backs can make it however you will bottom 

out once or twice
 bouldering madison river
im going to start this with stating that 
i am not a boulderer and have only boul
dered outside less than ten times at the most 

however i think i know of some outdoor 

bouldering opportunities for winter e best 

in my limited opinion is bouldering on the 

madison river roughly 40 miles out of boze
man towards norris hot springs the madison 

river bouldering is great for all types of climb
ers needing only one pad at a minimum the 

boulders are short but tricky and cruxy with 

numerous boulders from v0 to v7 there are 

various types from crimp ladders slopers to 

arte problems a favorite of the area is e 

buttery eect a one move wonder v5 mov
ing from a jug heel hook start to a hard crimp 

then jugs to top out since your skin will be 

so from pulling on plastic i highly recom
mend getting some quesadillas at norris hot 

springs aerwards and relaxing in the warm 

water more information can be found by 

googling madison river bouldering or check

winter in west yellowstone provides plenty of opportunities to explore
by andrew waters
with pristine wilderness well groomed 
trails geysers and mountains west yel
lowstone oers plenty of adventure even in 

winter e challenge is determining what to 

do in montana that challenge is even steeper 

with so many opportunities to explore what 

is around us while there are plenty of local 

attractions to keep us busy the m drinking 

house bridger bowl big sky ski resort 

hylite one that oen gets overlooked is yel
lowstone national park
e majority of roads that access the 
interior of the park are closed from early 

november through midapril generating 

the misconception that the park as a whole 

is inaccessible to be fair only three percent 

of the park can be accessed by road anyway 

so for tourists the park is by their standards 

inaccessible to begin with but yellowstone 

during the winter is just as exciting as it is 

during the summer with pristine snow

capped mountains overlooking plains that is 

the type of wilderness that makes you truly 

understand the purpose of national parks in 

the rst place without the inux of tour
ists even the mundane sections of the park 

become transcendent
to get to yellowstone head toward the 
west yellowstone entrance along us191 

it typically takes around two hours to get 

there depending on weather and any detours 

planned e drive is almost half the fun 

following the gallatin river through the 

mountains with peaks on both sides continu
ing on and past big sky once you reach west 

yellowstone it can be almost eerie and seems 

deserted during the summer its almost 

unbearable how many people compact them
selves into this small town you can hardly 

tell that you are now in what many consider 

nordic mecca    
e rendezvous trail system is more than 
21 miles of rolling groomed trails that can be 

taken on by even the most novice of skiers 

e dierent heights of pine trees make for 

varying degrees of shade that cause for amaz

ing tunnels that lead to open views of the 

mountain ranges 
while cross country skiing is a main 
attraction you can also take part in many 

other activities ose include snowshoe
ing backcountry skiing hiking snow
mobiling and a few others it is advisable 

to bring your own lunch as the prices are 

signicantly higher in the area overall the 

trip is worth it for whatever activity you are 

looking to do get out there and try a new 

adventure

bozeman favorites cure for the common touring northwest
by brook gardnerdurbin
cure for the common is bozemans favorite 
local band at is no exaggeration  it is 
simply a fact e electro thunder funk as 
they like to be known group played more 
than 100 shows last year and their dedication 
paid o with wins for both best local album 

and best local rock band of 2015 in bozeman 

magazines readers poll
like most local acts cure for the com
mon has gone through more than a few lineup 

changes since formation in 2008  or 2009  

or was it 2010 half the current members only 

know the origin story through folklore at this 

point and the others cant settle on a date some 

considered the group formed when the mem
bers rst performed live together others when 

they rst met and others when the crew rst 

began recording for their rst album together
e group consists of either ve or six peo
ple depending on whether or not you count 

frank douglass the man behind the bands 

impressive light show while he doesnt usu
ally contribute musically douglass has been 

known to take a break from working the lights 

to sing the occasional novelty song  e 

doors ghost song for a halloween show 

or flight of the conchords business time 

for a new years eve celebration e musical 

members of the group include two guitarists a 

bassist a keyboardist and a drummer drawn to 

bozemans music scene from around the state 

several graduated from msu
aer nishing their day jobs the group 
gathers for rehearsals at least three times a 

week where douglass helps with feedback 

e group also records many of their live 

shows allowing them to critique their perfor
mances and see where they need to focus un
like many small acts cure for the common is 
not content with taking it one show at a time 
 they have ambition
you can see every year were closer to full 
time said garrett rhinard the keyboardist 
were phasing out the day jobs
joe sheehan the drummer elaborated on 
their 10 year plan were trying to play e 

gorge by 2024 i think that would mean we 

had made it
in the meantime the group is trying to get 
work in commercials or get their music played 

in airports anything to get it heard douglass 

said were focusing on the live show not 

trying to mail out cds to big labels and get 

signed while the group resists the label jam 

band which has sometimes been attached to 
them they draw inspiration for at least their 
business model from acts like e grateful 

dead and phish
everyone in cure for the common cares 
deeply about not only their own music but us

ing their gi to help others rhinard said hed 

eventually like to form a label to help further 

promote the bozeman music scene and the 
group regularly plays benet concerts ey are 
in the process of setting up a nonprot to give 

a percentage of their proceeds to help per
petuate culture and the arts in montana were 
growing to the point of being able to do some 
real good sheehan said jordan rodenbiker 

the bassist added that one of our goals is to 

put montana on the map
living in montana places a strain on the 
group last summer they spent a month 

touring festivals in the southeast and were 

repeatedly asked questions like what state is 

montana in again or montana  thats in 

southern canada right
its hard to get to bigger markets sheehan 
said but part of the reason were even a band 

we even met each other is because we love liv
ing here e group has discussed moving to 
denver or another bigger city to gain a larger 
audience but so far the appeal of the bozeman 
vibe has kept them local
at isnt to say they can never leave town 
e band plans to go back to the southeast 

festival circuit again this summer and at the 

moment the group is preparing for a tour 

across the northwest with another genredefy
ing band north carolinabased papadosio
e tour will kick o in jackson wyoming 
before coming to bozemans emerson eatre 
later this week and the band is eager to get 

back on stage
its going to be a full emerson they prom
ised itll be a fun rowdy show we are going 

to deliver 60 minutes of hot re
cure for the common will perform at the emerson on wednesday feb 24 at 8 pm
tickets to the allages show are 20 and available at cactus records in downtown 
bozeman or online at 

 the bands albums are available at

the good dinosaurdisney pixar takes us back to 
the prehistoric era when dino
saurs roamed the earth and hu
manity was still losing their minds over 
fire and wheels in the good dinosaur 
it is a beautifully animated movie that 

just falls short of being memorable
in the good dinosaur a young 
apatosaurus named arlo is having a 

normal dinosaur day however his day 
is completely thrown out of whack when 
he discovers a caveman human against 

all odds the two of them become friends 

and go on an adventure where they must 
face their fears and trust each other 
throughout the movie their friendship 
blossoms and they grow up together
the good dinosaur shines is in its 
animation the movie is beautifully ani

mated and you wont want to take your 
eyes off the screen however thats about 

all of the positive aspects of the movie 
end the good dinosaur lacks an 
intriguing story just being a lot of things 

that happen to the unlikely duo the 
voice acting despite featuring some big 
names such as sam elliot anna paquin 
jeffrey wright and frances mcdormand 
is also poor taking away from the intense 
and emotional scenes
the big short
e big short went under 
a lot of peoples radar as it 
didnt start advertising itself 
until a month before its release 

despite this i was more excited about 
this movie than any other movie in 2015 
so entering the theater my expectations 
were high luckily the big short 
completely met my expectations 
its the mid2000s before the housing 
bubble burst everything seems to be go
ing well people are getting lots of loans 

and the banks are getting lots of money 

everyone is happy however there is 
something fishy going on with these 
loans that isnt being seen on the surface 
the loans are bad and most people are 

going to lose everything they have even 
though it was unexpected four people 
saw it coming jared vennett ryan gos

ling michael burry christian bale 
mark baum steve carell and ben rick
ert brad pitt using these predictions 

the four of them decide to go against the 
banks and short the stocks 
e four leads give electric performances 
especially bale and carell e big short is 

lled with laughs education near perfect 

acting and an eye opening to the economic 
crisis that tore the country apart in 2007
sisters
to kick off the end of 2015 
tina fey and amy poehler 
attempted to combine their 
comedic genius and make a movie un
fortunately the two comedic minds came 
up with sisters 
in sisters two siblings maura poehler 
and kate fey nd out that their parents 

plan to sell their childhood home and 
they need to go back home to move some 
old belongings while maura the calmer 

more downtoearth character completely 
understands kate who is spastic and wild 
throws a temper tantrum like a fouryear
old and decides to act rebellious kate con
vinces maura that to say goodbye to their 

old childhood home they should throw a 
party ey invite old highschool friends 
buy supplies do a bunch of childish things 
and eventually set up for the inevitable 

rager as every single movie of this type 
goes the party starts o well but eventually 
things take a turn for the worst and the two 

get themselves into trouble 
i like poehler and fey and their on
screen chemistry is obvious but thats 
where the good aspects of the movie end 
e two characters are completely unrelat
able and the comedy seems too forced 
most of the jokes come o like theyre 
expecting a punchline and it takes a lot of 

the believability out of the movie unless 

you really want to watch poehler and fey 
act like unconvincing teenagers i wouldnt 
recommend going to see sisters

to just improvising jazz music 
we mainly focus on improvisation and 
jazz but our style does vary away from that 

ford said our music is almost entirely 

originals that are made up on the spot but 

we also do some covers of classic rock metal 

and sometimes even pop we also have a 

couple of songs we call dub songs which 

have a dubstep feel which is very unique 

for a jazzstyle band it is dierent from 

everything else we do and really grabs the 

audiences attention
e band has been the house band for 
406 brewing for about three years our 

rst gig was at 406 ford remembered 

we have played at lots of other bars and 
breweries but were here every week and 

we all love it here i love the atmosphere and 

everyone seems to really enjoy what we do 

were the rst consistent band that 406 has 

kept for this long
everyone in the band performs with a 
high level of energy and the members are 

able to feed o of each other ford said the 

best part about the band is that they have 

freedom with improv to do what they want 

we dont have limitations on what we can 

do with the ability to start with one thing 

then instantly transition to something else 

almost eortlessly with just a simple glance 

or head nod we all know that were going to 

transition to something else along with how 

were going to do it e audiences really 

sound impressed with our ability to transi

tion being able to transition like this lets us 

feed o of each others energy well and adds 

a lot to our sound aer listening to a bit of 

their playing their transitions were indeed 

impressive and the abundance of energy in 

the group was apparent 
its easy to see that e vibe uartet 
plans to be around for awhile as they all 

enjoy working together ey get along well 

and a major part of their dynamic is a shared 

love and level of intelligence for jazz music 

over time this love of music has developed 

a respect amongst the members of the group 

and basically has negated any egos that may 

have been present ey all live to play with 

each other and it shows with how they act 

and play
if youre ever hungry and thirsty on a 
ursday there isnt a better place to go than 

406 brewing youll get great food great 

drinks and youll be able to listen to some 

of the most unique energetic music that 

bozeman has to oer

located on the outskirts of bozeman map 
brewing has taken a quaint old wooden farm
house and turned it into a certied taphouse 
complete with two oors of seating a replace 
board games and one of the most stunning views 
of the bridger mountains that you can get to 
top it all o they even have one of the most stun
ning selections of brews in the bozeman area 

it captures the essence of being in a ski lodge 
without having to spend time out on the frozen 
slopes and when you pass through the double 
doors you can feel the warm and cozy vibe
one of the more interesting things to take 
away from map brewing aside from the award 
winning brews is the unique decor it really 

helps with the overall feel of the room said sam 
willey a bartender at map brewing e major 
decorations were all done by my boss wife from 

the paintings of the landscape to the moose head 
made of scrap over the replace but thats not all 
i love about it she continued e owners are 

some of the best people ive ever worked for and 
i never dread going to work is statement is 
reected in the mood of the sta overall when 

you come in they dont seem to greet you with 
a rehearsed line like so many other businesses 

instead you can actually feel the excitement in 

the air
e mood of the sta can largely be credited 
to that of the owners e owners both come 
from the bozeman locale and they used their 
knowledge of the area to nd a place that feels 

like you were being welcomed aer a long day of 

skiing owners pat aka pk and dash started 
map with the sole purpose of focusing on beer 

rather than food and it shows e two owners 
worked within montana ale works for years 

but le aer seeing how there was not enough 
passion put into the beer that was being sold 
so the two decided that they would make their 
own place with the sole focus of creating brews 
that could t anyones palate eyve elected to 

have a food truck park outside their brewery to 
remove any possible distraction from the brews 
by major entrees instead the food truck grill 

406 serves mainly appetizer dishes such as pou
tine and nachos so if you want a light snack to go 
with your beer it wont distract from the taste
you may also be surprised to nd that map 
brewing is one of the few breweries in town to 

not have wi or televisions we want people to 
focus on having a good time and having a good 

drink willey said it feels more important that 

people talk with each other than lose themselves 
in a football game or a news broadcast is 
mood was immediately reected by the crowd 

in the bar within minutes of sitting down the 
couple at the next table struck up a conversation 
about their favorite drinks and recommenda
tions from the menu e goal of map is to 

create a friendly environment and they have 
succeeded with ying colors
en theres the ale itself all named aer di
rections you can take or ways that you can travel 
the ale is clearly brewed with love and care e 

sta favorite around the bar is called the steep 
terrain an india pale ale that has a clean and 
assertive bitterness with a malty background 

while bitter one cant help but notice the sweet 

aertaste that is brought on through the exten
sive use of hops e real crowd pleaser though 

is the northbound ale winner of the 2015 

montana brewers association fall brewfest 
gold medal this beer has a sweet malty biscuit 
avor with a kick of oral hops that is sure to 

make any patron leave map brewing with a full

last breweries you should skip in bozeman

33rd annual international food bazaar experience the world
by isabel loos
mark your calendars for saturday 
feb 20 because the sub ballrooms 
will be transformed into a cultural 

wonderland you wont want to miss 

countries from all over the world 

will be represented at the 33rd annual 

international food bazaar where 

international students  in collabora
tion with other msu students  will 

prepare traditional food from their 

home countries to share with the 

bozeman community most of the 

students running the booths will also 

be in traditional dress and there will 

be a myriad of unique performances 

throughout the evening from drum
ming to dancing to unicycling
 is is not a one person job its a 
team event said deborah chiolero 

one of the coordinators of the bazaar 
teams start preparing on ursday and 

friday to make their dishes to be shared 

with about 3000 people on saturday 

each team is able to use the msu food 

service kitchens in the union market 

and there is also a crew of chefs to help 

when needed e students do almost 

everything entirely by themselves from 

getting ingredients to cooking the food 

to decorating their booths each booth 

charges between about one and seven 

dollars per serving of food to oset the 

costs involved whatever is le over is 

then used for club events and activities 

other costs of the event are sponsored 

by the msu oce of international 

programs to help msu become a 

more culturally aware and enriched 

place
ere is also an element of compe
tition to the event four secret judges 

will be wandering booths judging 
them on their organization decora
tion and interaction with the crowd 

most students however care a lot 

more about sharing their cultures than 

about winning
when i see the students interact
ing and showcasing their countries 

its amazing to see their excitement 

chiolero said e energy is always 

high its amazing
ere will be 28 booths this year 
representing almost any country you 

can think of among them you will 

nd booths run by students in the 

international business club one will 

be a pakistani table where you can try 

cardamom chicken and pink tea both 

traditional dishes e students will 

be wearing traditional pakistani dress 

and decorating with kites and ajrak a 

traditional print
since we pakistanis like to talk 
a lot come and talk and gossip and 

have fun sobia anjum one of the 

students participating in the booth 

said she has been in bozeman since 

august working on pursuing a 

phd in environmental engineering 

another booth will feature three 

dierent desserts from three dierent 

countries a canadian dessert called a 

nanaimo bar sesame tahini cookies 

from mongolia and a filipino sheet 

cake called bibingka
i think of the food bazaar as a sur
prise you never know what you will 

encounter yanwen xu said she is 

from china and has been in the us 
for two years studying psychology 

and international business clearly 

there is much more to the food bazaar 

than just food
its great to get the word out 
that there are so many cultures on 

our campus chiolero said attend
ees get to meet people from all over 

the world and get a glimpse of their 

customs and traditions
 you dont need to get out of boze
man to see the world come to the 

food bazaar and youll be amazed by 

the culture diversity xu said it isnt 

every day that there is a global street

market right here on campus 
the bazaar will be in the su
b ballrooms on saturday 
feb 20 from 4  7 pm the event is free for msu

haynes hall receives funding for ventilation improvements
by dave biegel
students in the msu school of 
art can breathe a little easier 
knowing that improvements to the 
haynes hall ventilation system are 
on their way 
  this past week the funding for the first 

stage of improvements to the ventilation 

system was approved by the asmsu sen
ate 
haynes hall houses the school of art 
and was built in 1974 to meet the needs 

of the program at that time since then 

the demands from the msu school of art 

and art as a discipline have changed and 

the current ventilation system is unable 

to meet the needs of those that use the 

building according to vaughan judge 

director of the school of art this building 

was designed to keep all the air inside the 

building for heating purposes students 

in haynes hall work with metals welding 

torches oxy acetylene paints and paint 

solvents printmaking and ceramics with 

clay which puts silicate in the air and 

judge explained that once particulates or 

chemicals get in the air they dont leave 

the building multiple students have had 

air quality related health issues and judge 

noted that often students need to step 

outside of the classrooms because of light

headedness 
the air quality of haynes hall meets 
the standards set by the us department 

of labor occupational safety and health 

administration and there are no imme
diate or lifethreatening health risks to 

those that use the building complaints 
about air quality from students and faculty 
concern for student health and maintain
ing accreditation standards led the school 
of art and university facilities to push for 
the ventilation system improvements in 

haynes hall 
currently the school of art at msu is 
fully accredited by the national associa
tion of schools of art and design na
sad according to judge out of 1500 
schools that offer art and design programs 
across the country only 338 have full ac
creditation on their recent accreditation 
visit nasad highlighted the air quality 

of haynes hall as an issue and according 

to judge the msu school of art could 

lose our national accreditation because of 
the air quality of haynes hall because 
it does fall below nasad standards and 
guidelines judge stressed the importance 
of this accreditation because msus school 

of art is ranked 93 in fine arts education 
by the us news and world report 
students from many disciplines across 
campus utilize haynes hall according to 

judge the msu school of art has close 
to 400 art majors and 700 to 800 students 

taking an art core class and haynes hall 
has up to 1400 students a year using the 
building judge said i dont think there is 

one major on the campus that isnt in one 
of our classes
the 600000 needed for the first stage 
of improvements will come from building 
fees paid by msu students the funding 
has been approved by both the university 

facilities planning board and just recently 
the asmsu senate which must approve 
the use of student fees at amounts that 

large the first stage of the project will 
address the metals area a space highlighted 
because of concerns from melted metals 

fumes and chemicals according to randy 
stephens university architect with campus 
planning design and construction the 

project is broken up into five phases with a 
total expected cost of 25 million judge 
said the next stages will address ceramics 

sculpture and printmaking and that he 
hopes over a five year period the air quality 

will be up to scratch
the school of art has already spent 
100000 on the ventilation project with 
50000 addressing an immediate com
plaint in painting putting in a state of 
the art ventilation system for the painting 
studio that expels the fumes from that area 

outside the building the other 50000 
was spent on surveying all of haynes hall 

to come up with a conceptual plan for 
the rest of the building funding for these 

projects also came from student fees
due to the desire to minimize the 
projects impact on students that cur
rently use haynes hall most of the work is 

scheduled to be done during the summers 
when building usage is lower the project 
is expected to begin either summer 2016 or 

summer 2017

the msu school of art could lose our national accreditation because of the air 
quality of haynes hall because it does fall below nasa
d standards and guidelines

when was the last time you received 
hate mail or a death threat irshad manji 
receives them regularly a muslim reform
ist and bestselling author she seeks to 

get people to ask big questions accept 

diversity and stand up in the face of fear 

on feb 23 600 students and community 
members packed the sub ballrooms to 
hear manji speak at an event organized by 
the msu leadership institute
manji began her lecture by praising the 
msu leadership institute and msu say
ing that her first trip to montana would 
not be her last she then told her story 

beginning by recounting her experi
ence growing up grappling with religion 
and finding her voice she was born in 
uganda but at the age of four her family 
moved to british columbia canada she 

explained that from a very young age she 

was always asking questions she recalled 

being expelled from a muslim school at 14 

because she asked a question that offended 

her teacher she said that her tendency to 

ask questions and her constant pursuit of 
knowledge planted the seed for her future 
endeavors as an activist 
manji is the director of the moral cour
age project at new york university and 

has spoken at campuses across the country 
in an interview prior to the event manji 
said she tells her own story in order to give 
an example of where she has struggled and 

found courage she said she wants to put 
herself on the spot alongside her audience 
regardless of who the audience is i love 
to challenge said manji i never give 
people what they want to hear im there 

to offer a different perspective to ask a 

lot of questions and to puncture many 
assumptions
manji explained that although many 
people have told her she inspired them 
being inspired is not enough inspiration 
doesnt count for much in my books unless 
you activate it and thats what i want to 
know from people not just that you loved 
what you heard but how has it changed 
you and what will you now do differently 
as a result she said
for college students in particular manji 
wants to challenge assumptions about 
diversity and thinking in general prob
ably the most important principle to begin 
to grapple with is that colleges are not 

places that are supposed to be safe intel
lectually its quite the opposite actually 

manji said so instead of expecting your 

professors to create a safe space how about 

expecting professors to help you feel safe 

in your discomfort because thats the real 

world my friends and if you can handle 

the discomfort of the real world with a 

degree of confidence of selfassurance of 

selfknowledge then you are walking away 

from your college years a truly upstanding 

contributor to society
joey morrison a sophomore student 
associate at the leadership institute 

explained manji was chosen to speak 

at msu because we want to bring in 

people who serve in such a manner that 

helps students realize their potential or 

feel empowered that if they see an issue or 

they see something where they could step 

up they feel inspired to do so  
manji also explained that she thinks 
dissenting opinions are an inherent part of 

being human and that being offended can
not be avoided because different ideas 

will naturally offend different people 

offense is not a problem to be avoided 

at any cost offense is the cost of honest 

diversity so when we talk about diversity 

do we want it to be fake diversity or do 

we want it to be honest diversity and we 

should be asking that question of ourselves 

and each other
with regard to approaching people who 
may be hesitant to listen to someone say
ing that all religions sexualities and races 

should be accepted manji quickly pointed 

out that contrary to what may be assumed 

she thinks montanans are actually very 
open minded i was blown away to learn 
that msu has had a queer straight alli
ance for thirty years thirty years let me 
tell you something that is twenty years 

ahead of most ivy league colleges manji 
said it seems to me that there is some
thing about this state that keeps things real 
and so first of all hats off to montanans 

for coming to grips with reality now sure 

there are traditional people or conservative 
people not just here everywhere 
manji said she wants to see everyone 
feel the confidence to do the right thing 
without worrying about judgment after 

her lecture three student panelists were 
invited on stage to ask manji questions 
manji signed her books the trouble 
with islam today and allah liberty and 
love at the end of the event

involved known for the placement of ags 

in the grass along the centennial mall  

flags represent individual pledges from 

students to stand against interpersonal

ags are a visual reminder of the widespread 
problem of sexual assault wright said

compromise reached over polling location
by morgan kuntz
on tuesday feb 23 gallatin 
county commissioners voted 
to move the polling location for 

precinct 63b which covers part 

of the msu campus they met at 
9 am and voted 30 to move the 
location to the shroyer gym the 

polling location was previously 

hope lutheran church located 
at 2152 graf st controversy 
arose over the old polling location 

because some students believed it 

would make it difficult for them 

to exercise their right to vote 

hope lutheran is two miles from 

campus is not on a bus route and 
does not have sidewalks or bike 
lanes on part of the route
due to the opposition from 
students and activists commis

sioners approved moving the loca
tion to  msus shroyer gym last 

week as requested the commis

sioners received a contract reserv
ing the gym for three days in june 
2016 for the primary as well as for 
the general election in november 

msu waived the gyms normal 
4500 booking fee bringing the 
fees down to 2618 which will be 

paid by asmsu 
both msu president waded 
cruzado and asmsu president 

levi birky spoke at the meeting 

with cruzado advocating for 
accessible polling locations so 
students can embrace voting as 
their civic duty and birky stat
ing that msu is setting the stan
dard for learning and academic 

achievement in the community
some commissioners argued 
that turnout for collegeaged vot
ers is so low that making a move 
specically for them is unneces

sary further they contested that 
the move might actually result in 
a smaller voter turnout because 

parking will be an issue on campus 

which may make it seem less acces
sible to voters 
kiah abbey the eastern mon
tana program director of forward 

montana went on the record in 
response to the commissioners 
stating during public comment 
that she believed keeping the poll
ing location at hope lutheran was 
insidious saying its emblematic 
of an increased worth and invest
ment of resources ascribed to the 
voters that always show up at 

increased investment becomes 

recursive communicating to young 
voters voters of color and voters 
who are economically marginal
ized that their votes arent worth 

anything
she continued when you in
vest in deconstructing that myth 

when you show in your actions 
that you truly do care about all 
votes about the civic participa
tion about the representation 

of voters that may not look like 

you this goes to both my fellow 
citizens and my elected officials 
i think youll be surprised by the 

response you get
also up for discussion at the 
tuesday meeting was the possibil
ity of reserving the shroyer gym 
and parking spaces for the 2018 
2020 and 2022 elections aer 

the 2016 election a meeting is 

expected to be held to discuss the 
pros and cons of the move coun
ty commissioner steve white 
pointed to a recent bozeman daily 
chronicle article on parking issues 
at msu and expressed further 
concern about the accessibility of 

the msu campus as a viable poll
ing location commissioners are 

treating the move as a test run to 

evaluate potential issues
the next step is for election 
administrator charlotte mills 

to send voters a map indicating

by ian breuner
the mens basketball team 
travelled to missoula on satur
day feb 20 and competed in 
the second installment of the 

annual brawl of wild against 

the university of montana the 

bobcats came up short against the 

grizzlies losing 8778 
in a physical game between 
crossstate rivals it was the 

montana grizzlies that were able 

to grind out the victory the griz 

struck first opening up the game 

with a threeball from brandon 

gfeller but the cats rallied back 

to take a 1210 lead with a three

pointer from freshman tyler hall 

the bobcats went on a 115 run 

to establish a 2315 lead halfway 

through the first half but the 

griz fought back to tie it at 29 

apiece with 415 left in the half 

the griz finished off the first 

half with a 125 run leading the 

bobcats 4134 at the intermis

sion griz freshman michael 

oguine led all scorers at the break 

with 17 points 
the bobcats had a slow start to 
the second half and montana was 

able to hit two threes before the 
cats could answer the griz lead 

by double digits on multiple occa
sions throughout the second half 

but the bobcats always clawed 

back in it the cats fought to 

within one point at the 1241 

mark off of three freethrows 

from hall that would be as close 

as the cats would get however 

as the griz slowly rebuilt their 

lead back up to 11 at the 340 

mark the cats would not get 

much closer and the griz claimed 

another victory by the score of 

8778 for the griz oguine led 

the team in scoring racking up 27 

points for the grizzlies for the 

cats it was freshman phenom
enon hall who had a gamehigh 

30 points senior marcus colbert 

added 18 points and 5 assists for 

the cats while the cats held a 

3432 advantage over the boards 

the grizzlies held better shoot
ing percentages um shot 533 

to the bobcats 433 on field 

goal percentage and 600 to the 

cats 393 from deep msu went 

1522 from the charity stripe 

while montana drilled 30 of 42 

attempts 
the guys fought hard said 
bobcat head coach brian fish 
we got it down to a one two 

possession game but it seemed 

like every big possession they got 

themselves to the foul line and 

unless they change the rules you 

cant guard them there montana 

improves to 122 in big sky con
ference play montana state falls 

to 1214 overall 77 in big sky

the cats travel to weber state 
and idaho state on feb 25 and 

27 respectively for two more 

tough conference games down the

msu traveled to missoula last saturday 
feb 20 to rekindle its rivalry with universi
ty of montana e two big sky conference 
heavyweights came facetoface for their 
nal matchup of the regular season e 
last time these two met up it resulted in a 
montana state win riding o a second half 

rally to squash the montana lead and take 

the w montana at the time had a losing big 

sky conference record 45 but once a few 

weeks had passed montana state went into 

missoula to do battle against a winning griz 

roster who is now 95 
e rst quarter saw the bobcats re out 
of the starting gate putting up six points on 

the scoreboard in just under three minutes 

is lead was quickly overshadowed by 

montanas tough eld play forcing the cats 

to work the ball into the paint where for the 
rest of the game they would score almost all 
of their points from e cats closed out the 
rst quarter in the lead 1410
poor shooting against montana in the 
second quarter dug the msu womens 
basketball team into a hole that was too 

deep for them to climb out of for the 

entire game the bobcats made only 35 

percent of eld goals attempted compared 

to montanas 41 percent e cats severely 

struggled to connect outside of the arc 

completing only nine percent of three 

pointers it was the bobcats second worst 

shooting day of the conference season 

junior forward riley nordgaard can be 

credited with msus only three point 

completion she also was second to senior 

forward jasmine holmes for total rebounds 

with seven montana state valiantly fought 

back in the fourth and outscored the griz 

2621 but sadly this wasnt enough to 
make up for the massive lead that montana 
garnered in the second quarter 
montana state grabbed its only lead of 
the second half on a pair of free throws 
from junior guard peyton ferris with 25 

seconds to play but montanas junior 

guard haley vinings threepointer with 

14 seconds to play restored montanas lead 

and the grizzlies held on to hand msu a 

7066 loss
msu head coach tricia binford said 
msus rst half dry spell ultimately spelled 

doom for the cats chances of winning we 

had only eight points in the second quarter 

she said we need to be able to put points 

on the board when we dont make shots 

we cant play at our tempo and shots just 
didnt fall for us
msus scoring machine grinded to a 
complete stop getting outshot 228 is 
decit would haunt the cats for the rest 

of the game playing catchup to an agile 
montana squad although the second half 

saw great improvements in performance 
across the boards the cats never managed 

to climb out of the hole and losy 7066 
is is their rst loss in four weeks running 
out a six game winning streak
is loss will not stop the cats and 
their claim for the rst seed in the big sky 
conference posting a fantastic record of 
196 overall and 122 in league play e 

bobcats host weber state and idaho this 
upcoming weekend on feb 25 and 27 at

lot and i decide to try it out before i head up 

the trailhead 
its morning about 730 e sun is out but 
it hasnt gotten hot yet so its a perfect time 

to be shing i put on my backpack lace up 

my boots grab my bear gun and rods lock up 

the car and head to the river e rst spot 

i try for about ten minutes to warm up and 

get only one bite but thats it aer ten more 

minutes i decide to move on for greener 

pastures e hike is not dicult but its still 

a few miles to go before i reach my destina
tion and i want to get there before it gets too 

hot making good time about an hour later i 

nd what im aer 
e part of the lower madison that i love 
to sh is dierent from the rest of the river 

up further it becomes a true canyon and the 

slow meandering water gets squeezed into 

a bottleneck it picks up steam and comes 

crashing over rocks on the river bottom here 

and there are deep pools behind boulders 

the size of a person where sh like to hide 

and take a break from the predatorandprey 

daytoday rush of their lives e shing is 

tough but its worth it i catch two sh one 

thats two pounds and another thats twelve 

inches and lose myself in the art of making 

cast aer cast 
all too soon it is time for me to go it is 
almost high noon and i still have a ways 

to go back to the car and homework to do 

today so i take one last look at the river and 
say a quick thank you to the sh en i 

shoulder my pack
and as always i can still hear the water 
e whole time i am shing it never goes 

away i still hear it in my head when i walk 

back to the car and i imagine that it ows 

through my mind the same way it ows 

through the great canyons and elds of the 

earth never starting never stopping never 

ending never beginning sadly i cannot ll 

my days with nothing but shing i have to 

work and go to school and make money and 

spend money and make more money and pay 

bills and save money and pay more bills  

so i cant sh forever i can go to the water as 

much as possible but eventually i will have to 

leave but although i may leave the water the 

water never leaves me
psyched packed house at prince and princess of plastic competition
by parker webb
standing shoulder to shoulder in a 
crammed racquetball court turned climbing 
gym scores of climbers waited anticipating 

the commencement of the climbing clad 
in lycra tights bro tanks and rubbery ballet 
stickers these stone monkeys were getting 
psyched for the prince and princess of plastic 
climbing competition hosted at the msu 

gym with 37 competitors in the open 

division and 42 in the amateur heat it was 
a packed day inside the tiny climbing gym 
everyone from beginners to some of the best 

in montana showed up to compete and raise 
money for the expansion of the climbing 
space
 with amazing results from the open divi
sion six men and six women moved on to the 
nals round to compete to be crowned prince 
or princess for men ryan davis ben col
lins jessie christopher westy fitzsimmons 
jordan mills and bernard capulong quali
ed for nals womens nalists consisted of 

frannie taylor cheyenne stirling aubrey 
johnson delaney sigler kallista minge and 
kaitlyn mccarthy in a simplied way of 

scoring two problems were set for both men 

and women each and the nalists had a set 
amount of time to gure out how to climb 
the route ose that made it the furthest 
in the least amount of attempts would win 

davis and taylor became the prince and prin
cess of 2016 each topping one of their nal 

routes while getting tricked out of their sends 

by the route setters on the second amateur 

winners were daniel harvala for men and 
emma bode for women
overall however the competition was less 
about who won and is more about raising 
money for the walls expansion and generally 

having fun cheyenne stirling second place 

competitor for women and recent msu 
graduate said each year the routes get bet
ter and the crowd gets larger everyone feeds 
o the energy of each other e camarade
rie and laughter of trying hard and pulling 

down with friends is hard to beat denitely 

making the competition one of the best in 

montana e only downside is how crowded 
it is stirling continues stating e amount 
of people in the small space is scary at times 

with people falling o the top of route nearly 
missing someone on the ground the danger 
can be high e last thing anyone needs is 

a serious injury from the lack of space that 
msu has for the climbing e competition 
highlighted the need for expansion for safety 

reasons let alone for fun and introducing 

more people to climbing plus a larger space 
will make the event even more exciting and 
fun

as with laws specic rights may vary 
from state to state for instance a judge in 
montana might deem a search by police 

lawful while a judge in california where 

statutes dier from those here might rule the 

same search unlawful despite these dier
ences the laws of both states must still comply 

with the constitution and federal courts 

can make rulings that override decisions by 

lesser powers in theory this ensures that no 

states can pass a law that violates its citizens 

constitutional rights 
in montana the state has passed similar 
legislation to protect  students from rights 

violations by universities enacted in 1947 

montana code states that intrusions by 

peace ocers and other ocials exercising 

responsibility for law enforcement must 

be governed by 

standards and 

procedures no less 

stringent than 

those applicable 

to intrusions on 

private quarters 

outside institu
tions attorney 

audrey cromwell 

of cromwell law 

firm   rm 

contracted by 

asmsu to 

represent students 

 interpreted this statute as one which 

stops students from relinquishing their 

rights at a university cromwell added 

that montanans place a very high value on 

privacy
another 
example of laws 

with variations 

from state to state 

are stop and 

frisk laws ese 

statutes outline the 

abilities of police to 

stop and identify 

individuals and 

only exist in some 

states montana 

statute 465401 

gives police the 

ability to conduct an investigative stop and 

frisk in which they may request identica
tion chief of police robert putzke explained 

this as the ability of the police to ask for your 

name if they need to identify you they have 

the right to do so putzke said e police 
have the ability 

to identify you if 

youre suspected 

of committing a 

crime
cromwell 
conrmed putzkes 

statement saying 

that failure to 

cooperate in a 

stop and identify 

situation with the 

police could lead to 

criminal charges 
she said police can ask you for your name 

and date of birth and you have to give them 

that information cromwell continued you 

can be charged with obstruction of justice for 

hindering an investigation
while 
identifying oneself 

is necessary to 

avoid legal trouble 

cromwell said 

citizens have 

little obligation 

to communicate 

with the police 

past this juncture 

you dont have to 

answer questions if 
you dont want to she said cromwell voiced 

the importance of being polite and respectful 

when dealing with ocers you can say you 

want to speak to an attorney but you can say 

it in a way that isnt disrespectful or would 

further escalate any conict 
practicing your rights can be in your 
best interest in some cases cromwell pointed 

out anything you tell the police can be 

incriminating and can be used against you 

particularly pointing to instances where  

police ask do you know why i stopped you 

she also said that this applies in serious 

cases especially if its drugs or something 

a student might think is more than a 

misdemeanor cromwell still urged students 

to take the high road when talking to police 

citing a trait common to most people police 

ocers react better to you if you are nice to 

them and act civil
one of the more complex concepts in 
law is dierent burdens of proof for dierent 
scenarios where the states authority is enacted 

over an individual the state must have a 

certain level of proof that their actions are 

justied for instance a peace ocer can 

conduct a stop and frisk with the lowest level 

of justication called reasonable suspicion 

if the ocer nds further evidence an arrest 

may be made aer 

probable cause has 

been established 

that a crime was 

committed in a 

criminal court 

the judge or jury 

must have evidence 

beyond a reason
able doubt of the 

suspects guilt is 

diers from the 

burden of proof 

standard used in a civil court which is called a 

preponderance of evidence 
dean of students matt caires spoke 
on the signicance of these levels of proof 

in a university setting in a criminal court 

the burden of proof is beyond a reasonable 

doubt with conduct code violations we use 

a preponderance of evidence as our burden 

of proof putzke pointed out that the level 

of certainty for action in a court of law is far 

higher than that in the dean of students oce 

to prove beyond a reasonable doubt we 

have to be 90 percent certain we are correct 

preponderance of evidence is closer to around 

50 percent
cromwell and putzke both used the 
example of oj simpsons murder trial to 

show the dierences in levels of burdens of 

proof oj simpson was found not guilty of 
his wifes murder in a criminal court due to 

lack of evidence but the wrongful death suit 

led by his deceased wifes family was ruled in 

favor of the family when tried in civil court 

while there was not sucient evidence 

to put the defamed football star behind 

bars the evidence provided was enough to 
convince a civil 

jury that he should 

be held responsible 

for his wifes death 

putzke said this 

discrepancy is due 

to the severity of a 

possible conviction 

or decision in 

a criminal case 

the defendants 

freedom is at stake 

while conduct 
hearings at a university or a civil lawsuit 

could only result in nancial loss or expul
sion from school
knowing your rights
as a student and citizen
e us bill of rights outlines a list of basic rights that all citizens have here are the most basic of american rights such as the right to free speech the right to bear arms 
and the protection against unwarranted search among others e founding fathers penned these rights but to this day their interpretations are everchanging with new 
court rulings making their actual meanings in our everyday life unclear while circumstances play a role in any legal situation knowledge of ones rights and how they apply 
not only in a court of law but also at the university conduct level is vital for students who might nd themselves dealing with the law 
jurisdictional differences
speaking 

to the police
burdens of proof
police can ask you for 
your name and date of birth 
and you have to give them 
that information you can 

be charged with obstruc
tion of justice for hindering 

an investigation

in voting to move the precinct 63b polling 
location to shroyer gym however commis
sioners still have a responsibility to continue 

helping bridge the gap between 

millennials and their government 

ey should take note from asmsu 

president levi birky who ended his 

public comment at the commission 

meeting tuesday feb 24 with a 

reminder of his nonpartisan duty to 

constituents i do whats best for the 

students i represent 
e commission has taken a cru
cial step in uniting college students with  local 

community government ey made it clear at 

the meeting that they didnt view this vote as a 

rst step but instead as a test run and explic

itly stated that they had no intention of moving 

the other seven precincts from hope lutheran 

church 2152 graf st two miles south of 

msu via 19th ave 
while their assertion that this does not con
stitute a rst step regarding community polling 

locations was premature the commissioners did 

nd a way to work with the university for positive 

change regardless of whether shroyer gym ends 

up serving gallatin county precinct 63b better 

than hope lutheran church students did step up 

and negotiate with the local community govern
ment to ensure their voices were heard
commissioners expressed one nal concern 
about moving the polling location election 

judges election judges are local citizens who are 

trained to ociate polling in local precincts e 

elections oce aims to train around 400 people 

countywide but typically only around 200 peo
ple actually show up to serve as election judges 

because people begin training before realizing 

how complicated the process is e information 

box at right details the process of becoming an 

election judge in gallatin county when fewer 

polling locations are consolidated election judges 

are divided between more locations
president waded cruzado set a precedent 
for leadership aer the meeting stating that she 

planned to volunteer as an election judge in order 
to help with the shortage cruzado is sacricing 
one of her few days o in support of a student 

cause leaders like cruzado are both commend
able and essential for young voters who have been 

systematically marginalized in gallatin county 
her decision is a massive step in the right direc
tion for a young generation that has been margin
alized instead of mentored by their elders 
county commissioners later challenged 
students to know their responsibilities when 

registering to vote but id like to challenge the 
county commissioners to know what their 
responsibilities are as elected representatives 
firsttime voters face huge obstacles including 
antiquated paper voter registration the over
whelming amount of misinformation available 
and a troublesome generational disconnect join
ing the conversation of democracy isnt easy and it 
is the duty of individuals who understand democ
racy and the complex issues in society 

to help make the transition easier 
e commissioners have done well 
thus far in listening to young peoples 

discontent with polling locations 

moving forward it is certainly their 

responsibility to continue providing 

a seat at the table for all people even 

the young ones 
students championed positive 
change regarding this issue getting the closest 

precinct to campus moved to a polling location 
at shroyer gym however their work is far from 
done county commissioners will be even more 

hesitant to cooperate with students in future en
deavors if students fail to turn out to vote this year 
further if students want to be represented more 
fairly in future elections they must invest time in 

nding and electing candidates that represent their 

values millennials are a generation that value the 

truth  and its time to speak the truth to power 
if young people truly feel they havent been well 
served by these commissioners that will only 

change if they show up and vote on election day 
so yes  commissioner skinner  this is a rst 
step is is the rst step in what will be the long 

and arduous process of reconnecting youth with 

their government but its a process worth investing 

in young people are always worth investing in

what it take campaign leading campus in the direction of engineering
earlier this month msu received 
a generous donation of 6 million 
from local business owners tim and mary 
barnard which has been pledged to the 
college of engineering and to 
the south campus develop
ment project tim barnard is 

the founder of the bozeman

based civil engineering company 
barnard companies inc which 
regularly hires msu graduates 

there are currently 50 msu 

graduates employed including 
five members of the executive 
management team and 45 from various 
engineering fields 
the majority of the donation 5 
million has been allocated to the south 

campus development project which brings 

msu within 3 million of its 70 million 
target this includes the construction of 
the norm absjornson innovation center 

which will aim to promote interdisciplin
ary engagement and respond to emerging 

trends in education the center will be 

open to all students but will be anchored in 

the rapidly growing engineering depart
ment the remainder of the donation will 
be earmarked for the engineering depart
ment itself 
this donation will aid msu in the 
what it takes campaign they 
are currently running aiming to 
raise 300 million for the univer
sity which will be used for vari

ous projects from scholarships 

and professorships to departmen
tal improvements however it 

appears that a lot of this is being 

directed to the improvement and 
expansion of the engineering 
department which is already world class 

msu prides itself in being a stem sci
ence technology engineering and math
ematics institution but what about all the 

other fields 
there seems to be a lot of work to gain 
funding for the engineering department 

but not much of a push to gain funding 
for other departments although boasting 
a technologically advanced campus with 

excellent resources and conducive learning 
environments there are still many areas 
that have need for improvement 
an important but rundown building 
on campus is romney gymnasium built 
in 1922 which used to be considered an 
integral part of the campus hosting a vari

ety of cultural events  but now nearly 100 
years later time hasnt been kind although 
still structurally sound the interior has 
become neglected and is underused mainly 
featuring storage a 10000 foot abandoned 

swimming pool and some physical educa
tion classes plans to renovate romney 

gym have been proposed during the past 

two legislative sessions but they have all 
fallen through for one reason or another 
the building has a ton of potential to 
provide students with a quality learning en
vironment so its a shame they cant align 

their plans and push a renovation budget 
through
another area that could utilize funding 
are the classrooms in roberts hall wilson 

hall and anywhere else that has those an
cient small and uncomfortable deskchair 

contraptions the desk space is minimal 

and barely sufficient for a notepad  nev
ermind a laptop the inclination of the 

back is unforgiving and provides little to 
no lumbar support taking students one step 
closer to that hunchback theyve always 
wanted 
handicap accessibility is also something 
that could be significantly improved on 

campus with a few buildings lacking eleva
tors and ramps to the entrances restricting 

people with mobility impairments from 
entering the building such buildings 
include but arent restricted to herrick 

hall and the aforementioned romney 

gymnasium funding could be justifiably 

used to install elevators and access ramps 

to these buildings and make campus more 

hospitable to those with disabilities and 
impairments
whilst the money pledged to engineer
ing is greatly appreciated and msu will 

be forever grateful to anyone who chooses 
to donate there needs to be more effort 

in obtaining funding for the areas where 

its really required beneficiaries should be 

informed of the looming fallbacks of the 

campus through the campaign so they can 

help make the campus allround excep

safe zone program promotes understanding of lgbtqiq community
since the beginning of the new year the is
sues that face the lgbtqiq community 
have become increasingly public at msu in 

january the ueer straight alliance qsa a 

student club on campus sent an email to the 

administration in response to gov 

bullocks executive order intended 

to protect state employees against 

discrimination based on sexual ori

entation and gender identity strong 

reactions not surprisingly came 

from both sides of the aisle
e online comment section 
for the bozeman daily chronicles 

article on the subject was a particu
larly good showcasing of both sides in action 

ere individuals used a combination of logic 

rhetoric facts gures and the occasional video 

link in attempts to sway everyone else to agree 

with their point of view by the time the dust 
had settled however everyone seemed to be 

more entrenched in their starting positions
is came as no surprise debates rarely 
change minds because they are primarily 

oppositional in nature e only minds that 
debate will change are the minds of 

those who did not have an opinion 

on the subject in the rst place too 

oen when human beings watch or 

participate in debates it is to reaf

rm their own beliefs rather than to 

challenge those beliefs
an alternative to debate is dia
logue dialogue invites the partici

pants to examine their own beliefs 
it is collaborative in nature and promotes 

mutual understanding instead of focusing on 

the dierences between the participants
debates like the one on the chronicle 
website will not help the bozeman and msu 
community come to an understanding but 

participating in dialogue will understand
ing where the other side is coming from is 

necessary for making the best decision for 

everyone involved when it comes to matters 

of law and public policy in order to for each 

side to develop a real understanding of the 

other real dialogue needs to take place at 

is the goal of msus safe zone program
safe zone was created to provide educa
tion about lgbtqiq issues and to promote 

awareness of these issues to the public accord
ing to ariel donohue the program direc

tor nine percent of the msu student body 

identify as lgbtqiq it is unknown to what 

extent the issues raised in qsas email aect 

all lgbtqiq students but what is known is 

that lgbtqiq students comprise a signi

cant sector of the student population which 

has unique concerns and experiences
e goal of safe zone is to promote 
individual and community understanding of 

these concerns and experiences through free 

voluntary courses for the public as well as 

through courses for campus departments and 

classes that are interested what individuals 

choose to do following safe zone varies ac

cording to donohue
safe zones methods are not the catchall 
solution for creating positive social change 

but they are an important part of that 

process understanding an issue is the rst 

step towards dealing with the root causes 

that drive it e time and eort required to 

develop that understanding can be discourag
ing but as more people seek to understand 

the issues that concern the lgbtqiq 

community on campus the more likely the 

campus will see changes that are benecial 

and satisfactory to the whole community
one cannot deny the good intent 

behind msus blue light emergency 
phone system rape and sexual assault 
among other incidences are highly preva
lent on college campuses and measures 
should exist to deter their 
occurrences e blue light sys

tem was established on msus 

campus in 2009 as one of those 

safety measures however the 

system may be as ineective as 

it is obsolete
first a look at what the blue 
light system is and does the 

campuswide system consists 

of 10 emergency phones seven of which 

are solarpowered placed in sporadic loca
tions around campus grounds e phones 

are equipped with two buttons one 
labeled emergency which contacts 911 
emergency services and lights a blue strobe 

light and one labeled information which 

contacts the university police depart
ments nonemergency services for general 

information here the system seems to be 

an eective resource for crime deterrence 
but what is the blue light system doing that 
cellphones are not
e purpose of the system according to 
msu is to enhance the safety and security 

of the community something personal 

safety apps can provide in the palm of their 

users hand e major dierence is that 
the blue light system costs hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to establish and tens 

of thousands to maintain annually whereas 
personal safety apps and dialing emer
gency services an ability all cellphones are 
required by law to have regardless of the 
phones active or inactive status ranges 

from being free of cost to a few dollars per 
month in charges
beyond just the dierence in 
price though is the dierence in 
use over half of all 911 calls are 
made by cellphone e university 

of north carolina at greensboro 

uncg has 78 emergency 
phones in the form of blue light 
towers with an additional 52 

emergency phones present in 
other forms of the nearly 11000 calls 

for service uncgs police department 

received in 2013 only 90 came from the 
blue light system in fact some universi
ties claim the majority of blue light phone 

system calls are either pranks or activated 
mistakenly which has motivated several 
universities to downsize or in new mexico 

state universitys case eliminate the pro
gram altogether
outside of dialing 911 the other main 
function of msus blue light towers is to 

contact nonemergency services for campus 
information most campus information can 
be obtained through the askus service in 

the sub or via msus website it seems a 
waste of resources then to even have an 
information button virtually any service 

sought can be found online meaning that 

in todays hightech society the blue light 
system has been rendered obsolete

the state of montana is home to 
seven different native american 
reservations so having a university that 
is supportive and actively trying to help 
natives obtain a higher education in 
the same state is a necessity as such 
msu has many resources on campus 
to help guide native students on their 
own pathway to success one 
of the first things that all 
incoming freshman students 
go through is a three day long 
orientation which includes 
a campus tour meeting an 
advisor learning more about 
oncampus activities and 
clubs and even scheduling 
their first semester  however 
all students who selfidentify 
as native american have their own two 
day orientation prior to the universitys 
orientation called native pathways to 
success it focuses on connecting native 
students not only to each other and 
faculty but also to the land around the 
university because much of the sur
rounding land was sacred to many native 

ancestors
while the native pathways to success 
orientation is a wonderful opportu
nity for incoming native freshmen to 

get a feel for the university and meet 
other native students actually being on 
campus for the first time submerged in 

the general student 
population can be 

very overwhelming for 
someone who identi
fies as a minority on 
campus which is why 

the american indian 
alaskan native stu
dent success is focused 
on helping students 
achieve academic suc
cess while still foster
ing cultural heritage  
the american indi
an student center is a 
safe place for students 
to study and meet other msu students 
its located in wilson hall and provides 

computer access free printing copying 
and faxing tutoring access academic 
advising and a variety of other student 
support the american indian student 

center also plays host to meetings for 
the american indian council aic 
the aic meets every thursday at 5 pm 
and is always open to the public  one 
of their biggest focuses is on the annual 
powwow that is put on every year the 
aics powwow is one of the oldest 
running events on campus and this year 

will be the 41st annual powwow taking 

place march 2526 in the brick breeden 

fieldhouse
even though msu offers many differ
ent ways for native students to get in
volved and receive support that doesnt 
mean that racial discrimination 

doesnt exist there are roughly 

only 249 students who self iden
tify as native american making 
up only 2 percent of the student 
population while 85 percent 

of the student population self 

identifies as white the fact that 

native americans are a minority 

isnt the problem here though 
the problem is the way some students of 

the majority treat students of the minor
ity it is a problem of ignorance and lack 

of empathy from the majority which is 

something we as a majority all have to 

collectively work to fix together because 

it is possible and it is necessary 
while msu pushes more and more 
natives from across the country to at
tend the university and gain a higher 

education that doesnt always mean 

that msu is always pushing students to 

create safe spaces for everybody to thrive 

including people who selfidentify as a 

minority on campus there have been 
many students who 

have voiced their 

concerns about campus 

not being all inclusive 

but there are many 

students who are legiti

mately afraid to speak 

up about the discrimi

nation they face on a 

daily basis and that 

needs to change 
the thing is though 
is that change cannot 

be institutionalized 

it has to start with 
us the student body it starts with the 

students standing together and not 

letting race or ethnicity be catalysts for 

argument but for learning something 

new from your fellow student it starts 

with acceptance and the understanding 

that while we all might have differing 

opinions and viewpoints it starts with 

constructive intelligent conversations 

where we listen so deeply that we are 

changed by what we hear

 15why do i need is putting the 
paperwork in study abroad
all students should study abroad at 
being said not everyones version 
of studying abroad should be the same 
studying abroad has as much to do with 
stepping outside of what is comfortable as 
it does learning about new cul
tures nothing says crazy trust 
exercise like putting ones life on 
hold to jump into the hopefully 

open arms of a strange univer
sity in a foreign country it is a 
process that teaches self reliance 
independence and adaptability 

to rise to unexpected challenges 
at process begins with the 
decision to study abroad
every college fair and club meeting 
makes living abroad seem like the very 

next step aer deciding to go somehow 
everything just clicks into place and there 
is no time between dreaming about paris 

to ordering a croissant on champselysees 
what the pamphlets dont say is that about 
half of the experience comes before and 

aer the time abroad 
from the moment the decision to 
study abroad is made the brainstorming 

process begins when where how and is 
this nancially feasible e international 
aairs oce is a great resource however 
they can only go so far e surprising thing 
about studying abroad is that the push for 

independence starts with the application 
how many countries are even in the world 
picking a college within the united states 

seems easy when compared to choosing a 
country let alone a college
all the burden of research and the 
educated decision to follow rests on the 
travelers shoulders no one else can choose 
when where or why to study somewhere 
e student needs to spend the hours 
combing through university websites and 
student reviews at process 

alone could take weeks aer 
that there are only mounds 
of paperwork stacks of forms 

and countless queries that cant 
be answered through internet 
searches all that on top of rigor
ous course work a job social life 

balanced sleep schedule  but 
lets be real no one can have all 

of those things 
it may only be a semester abroad but the 
commitment to the project is at least a year 
e application and preparation takes the 

entire semester before leaving and upon the 
return things dont go immediately back to 
normal e student has been fundamental
ly changed she got to experience the world 

in a dierent light she has an obligation to 
share that discovery with others she could 
become an msu ambassador or present at 
elementary schools education would be 
extremely limited if it only took place in 
a classroom e community and culture 
exchange students bring back for the rest of 
their lives brings balance to the semester of 
forms they lled out before
studying abroad will be a lot of work but 
it will be the kind of work where the direct 
impact of each decision can clearly be seen 
e nightmares of passports and visas dis
solve in the bright moroccan sun or on the 
slopes of norway

betrayal at house on the hill is a criti
cally acclaimed board game which came back 
into print by popular demand when it rst 

came out in 2004 the game was very well re
ceived with critics but unfortunately was not 

so well received with fans e board game 

was undersold and under marketed which 

made it a prime target to be pulled from the 
shelves of game stores nationwide hasbro 
reacting to the underwhelming release of the 
product decided that they would stop print
ing copies of it and almost erase its existence 
it wasnt until the king of the nerds himself 

wil wheaton found himself a copy and 

played it on his board game showcase show 

tabletop that demand for the game shot 

back up aer seeing the rise in demand for 

the game skyrocket hasbro quickly released 

an updated version with improved art and 
rules to meet the rising demand for the once 

commercial failure giving players everywhere 

a second edition
e box says betrayal at house on the 
hill is a haunting experience for three to six 

players players take the role of explorers  all 

with interesting backstories and abilities  

that have come to the mansion on the hill to 

investigate strange incidents what the players 

dont know is that one of them is a traitor in 
disguise that halfway through the game will 
reveal him or herself and try to act out their 
evil plan ese evil plans take place in the 
form of haunts that range from rampaging 
demons to hillbilly cannibals where the traitor 

must require him or her to do one of a multi

tude of tasks ranging from killing the survivors 

to setting up bombs throughout the house
e game itself is an homage to movies 
from the 50s like frankenstein or e 

invisible man that is craed with love 
from creators who clearly know their source 

material looking into the backstories of the 

player characters you can easily see each and 

every horror movie trope  each is made to 

be more obvious than the last as the players 

enter the mansion they will take turns draw
ing room tiles out of a pile to slowly layout 

the mansion square by square because each 

tile is random there are thousands of dier
ent combinations of rooms that can be laid 
out meaning that every time you play the 
game it turns out dierently e players go 
from room to room encountering events like 
ghosts or oozing walls that can either reward 
them with helpful items or punish with them 

ill omens each time an omen is drawn the 

players must determine whether the traitor is 

revealed through dice rolling 
when the traitor is revealed the haunt 
begins and the players must act out a tropey 

cliched horror movie plot to resolve it in 
total there are 50 dierent haunts that com
pletely change how you play the game for 
example the traitor player may decide that it 

is time for a ghost wedding and be compelled 

to kill the other players so that they might 
attend the wedding in the haunted chapel or 
the players may nd the house is being lled 

with poison gas and need to x the pipes or 

suocate to death 
e game is magnicently craed and due 
to massive variance in both playstyles and 

board layout the game can be enjoyed many 

more times over than games like risk or 

monopoly just remember to have yourself a 

happy haunting

backcountry film festival the adventures of a lifetime all in one night
by isabel loos
everybody knows bozeman is a ski 
town coming from a place where 
the sport was not as prevalent i 

have loved being surrounded by the 
culture and stoke that living here pro
vides because of the huge communi
ty of outdoor enthusiasts who like to 
get together and have fun bozeman 
is the perfect stop for the backcoun
try film festival which was in town 
on tuesday feb 22 at the emerson 
center for arts and culture
 e backcountry film festival 
put on by the winter wildlands 

alliance is a collection of thought

provoking lms that feature back
country or other human powered 

recreation with an emphasis on 

environmental awareness and 
conservation ey are all winter
oriented intending to both educate 

and excite viewers about the season 
e festival premiers in boise 
idaho and then travels to more than 

100 towns worldwide reaching 

over 20000 outdoor enthusiasts
e winter wildlands alliance 
was formed in 2000 based on the 
idea that skiers snowboarders 
snowshoers and anyone else who 
enjoys outdoor adventures needed 
a voice regarding issues that impact 
the winter backcountry ey have 

a national presence by working with 

forest service national park ser
vice and elected ocials to support 

policies that allow this recreation 
to continue e alliance supports 
a number of snowsports groups 
throughout the country to help 

with issues that might aect their 

local backcountry areas and give 

back through their snowschool 

which helps get over 30000 kids 
outside in the winter every year 
e rst annual backcountry 
film festival was organized in 2005 
when a local organization such as 
the montana backcountry alliance 
and the montana wilderness as

sociation decides to host the festival 

the money it costs to screen the lms 

goes to the winder wildlands alli

ance to support their work all other 
proceeds from ticket sales go to the 
local hosting organization more 
than that though the festival helps 

spread the word about backcountry 

recreation and build excitement for 

the coming season
 one of the featured lms shiing 
ice was lmed and produced by 
kt miller who was born and raised 
in bozeman it told the story of ve 
women and their expedition sailing 
from iceland to greenland through 
ice wind and storms to ski towering 

peaks on the west coast of greenland 

e purpose of their journey was to 

raise awareness about climate change 

and environmental issues and promote 
female snow sports adventures while 
having a crazy adventure with friends
its not a matter of whats pos
sible its just how said miller 
who was at the showing to answer 
questions she encouraged everyone 
to dream big and her excitement 

was contagious on their trip they 
limited their environmental foot
print by sailing and climbing instead 
of ying and using snowmobiles to 

get to their lines she said that every 
little thing you can do to make a 

dierence helps i like to think of 
it as circles of inuence if you cant 
change yourself how will you be 

able to change everything else
e festival will more than likely 
be back again next year as bozeman 

is an ideal audience keep an eye out 
for updates on when the 20162017 
tour will be passing through and 

visit 
winterwildlandsorg

more about the organization and 

what you can do to contribute to the 

important work they are doing

e   17citizen kane 
  the best movie of all time  turns 75
by adam waldorf
in the early 1930s and 1940s cinema was 
completely dierent from anything we see 
today e background of shots were out of 

focus causing the audience to focus on just 

what was closest to the camera all of the 

shots were short and choppy and there were 

few ashbacks or ashforwards making mov
ies painfully linear however 1941 changed 

the face of cinema forever with the release 

of one movie citizen kane it revolution
ized the way movies have been made and its 

impacts on cinema can be seen in nearly every 
movie in todays world
citizen kane which turns 75 this year is 
legendary director orson welles most well
known movie e movie begins with a ash
back of millionaire newspaper powerhouse 

charles foster kanes life e ashback 
gives a general insight as to why kanes life 
was important as he was the biggest name 

in newspaper and reporting unfortunately 

kane dies as soon as the movie opens  this 

is where the mystery that made the lm so 

famous begins ere is mass confusion about 

kanes departing words in kanes last mo
ments he is clutching a snowglobe and mut
ters one last word before he dies rosebud 

e entire movie follows a reporter as he digs 
into the past of the kane to nd out who or 
what rosebud is 
despite various plot holes that have been 
found over the years citizen kane is 
regarded by many as the best movie of all time 

is praise is due to how it revolutionized the 

movie industry changing the way movies were 

made and how stories were told in movies 
welles cinematic masterpiece inuenced 
movie making in many dierent ways e two 

most substantial ways that it changed lm was 

through deep focus photography and non

linear storytelling before citizen kane was 

made movies were primarily shot in a fashion 
where what was taking place closest to the cam
era was clear and focused where everything else 
in the shot was blurry  is made the movies 

seem unrealistic with deep focus photography 

everything is in focus making everything clear 

and believable citizen kane was the rst 
movie to use this type of lming with success 
and its currently the norm for most lm 
e movie was told almost entirely 
through ashbacks as the reporter dug into 

kanes life trying to nd the meaning of 

rosebud it was the rst big movie to ever 

use storytelling that wasnt completely linear 

and since has revolutionized the way stories 

are told in lm if you take a look at most of 

the movies being made nowadays they dont 
take place in one certain point in time most 
movies jump around to dierent points in 
time to enhance the story and provide insight 
into the characters way of thought 
ose are just a couple of ways citi
zen kane revolutionized movies it also 
introduced new camera angles new types of 

acting new types of sound  the list goes 
on for miles rough all of these techniques 
citizen kane introduced new ideas all 
at once that changed the movie industry 
forever movies today may not have the same 

quality if orson welles never took a risk and 
tried new ideas while making citizen kane 
we have him to thank for the way we watch 
movies today

someone you had your eye on in any case 

waking up in an unfamiliar bed next to 

someone can always be a jarring experience 

whether its your rst onenight stand or your 

twentieth but that doesnt mean it has to be 

shameful or awkward
e nice thing about college is that there 
are plenty of options to pursue and its a time 

for experimentation and nding out what 

gets you going each weekend can be a new 

opportunity for you  a new person a new 

position or a new twist  provided that the 

encounters are consensual and enthusiastic 

of course but that doesnt mean your math 
class should become your buet line trying 

a new bite every week without care because 

unlike buet food your partners have feel
ings
today were talking about onenight stand 
etiquette if you only take one thing from this 

article have it be this as long as both parties 

know what theyre looking for out of the 

encounter then re away when both parties 

are interested in nostringsattached sex and 

are on the same page about it then it can be 

a fun way to enjoy a hopefully pleasurable 

experience however when things play out 

dierently feelings can be hurt or worse 
at said heres a few more rules to ensure 
that everyone has a good time
 try to remember their name or at least 
get the rst letter right dont fake it if youve 

forgotten though that never ends well no last 

names  you dont want to know too much
 nothing too weird keep things simple if 
you didnt know about it in eighth grade you 

may want to save it for your second time if 

there is one
 always use protection no one wants 
a new itch or to be in a threeyear paternity 

suit
 know how to nd the bathroom quietly 
ese things oen lead to late nights  no 

need to exacerbate your partners lack of 

sleep by waking them up in the middle of the 

night
 maybe keep deodorant and an extra shirt 
in your car in case you dont have time to go 

home before heading to work or school in the 

morning
 dont judge their ugly furniture or lack of 
artwork its ok to judge their thread count 

though
 remember theyre probably as scared of 
you as you are of them everyone has insecu
rities some people are just better at hiding 

them than others
 if you had a good time and want more 
oer your contact info remember your part
ner may never want to see you again though 

and dont get pushy
 exit gracefully

anita sarkeesian aims to make feminist theory more accessible
by 
ti
m gauth
ieri do this work because 
i love pop culture 
stories said  anita sarkeesian a wellknown 
advocate for feminism in mainstream media 
during her march 2 lecture 
ill make a man 
out of you  
redening strong female char
acters sarkeesian claimed that the role of the 

storyteller has largely been taken from families 
and communities and went on to discuss how 
that role is manifested and oen marginalized in 
todays world
characters are oen described in the 
patriarchal sense sarkeesian explained her 
examples included the video game god of war 

bruce willis in die hard and tony stark of 
avengers notoriety she showed a video where 
megan fox said guys dont like it when you 
know more about cars than they do which she 
followed with the rhetorical question have 
we really advanced in our portrayal of strong 
women sarkeesian is the executive director of 

the video web series feminist frequency which 
she started in 2009 while in graduate school at 
york university in toronto 
e everpopular halo series also suers 
from stereotype even without a playable female 

character sarkeesian noted that cortana a ho
lographic sage to the master chief is more 

and more sexualized in every new installment 
even the franchise director himself frank 
oconnor openly admitted this in october 

2015 one of the reasons she does it is to attract 
and demand attention and she does it to put 
people o so theyre on their guard when theyre 
talking to her and that she has the upper hand in 
those conservations
sarkeesian made an important distinction at 
this point between sexualization and sexuality 

the former makes something sexual in character 
while the latter allows for the capacity for sexual 
feelings e lecture worked to contrast these 
concepts she said that sexualization is a tool 
to minimize womens power that runs counter 
to the fact that women have intrinsic value as 
people sarkeesian also noted that women are 
commonly not allowed to hold real power 
unless they are sexually objectied as a form of 
subservience her statistic that only four women 
have been nominated for best director at the os

cars in its history highlights the startling amount 
of disparity that has been present for generations  
sarkeesian identied actresses that portray 
admirable traits as well including buy sum
mers buy the vampire slayer kathryn 

janeway star trek voyager and 
rey star 
wars  she explained that buy never uses her 
sexuality as power and has a very clear charac
ter development which proves that we dont 
need perfect human beings to tell good stories  
janeway valued diplomacy over violence sar
keesian said and 
rey represents a counter to the 
notion that heroes of legend are almost always 
male to the perception that the mainstream 

is censored to force womens roles she made it 

clear that having more stories has nothing to do 

with censorship  studios actively change their 

culture to make them more inclusive 
while her lecture focused on how women are 
portrayed in the media sarkeesian was inspired by 

her personal exposure to sexism and abuse while 

online gaming to represent womens rights she 

was featured in a t
ime magazine article in 2015 
as one of the 100 most 
inuential people where 
she discussed gamergate an online harassment 

campaign regarding progressivism and sexism in 

video games she received rape and death threats 

from hateful misogynist male gamers she shared 

a statistic that 70 percent of women involved 

in online gaming play with male avatars which 

lends not only to the stereotypes discussed previ

ously but also fear for personal safety her video 

series tropes vs women in videogames gives 

detailed background on gaming and its demean
ing treatment of women
sarkeesian remains optimistic about the 
future of feminism in mainstream media she ex
plained how developers are now being pressured 

to expand games in 2016 and beyond another 

damsel in distress  her advice to students  

speak up and say this isnt good enough we 

want more

anita sarkeesian spoke to a packed crowd wednesday night in the sub ballrooms with a different

intercollegiate ski lm competition
e red bull bracket 
reel snow 
challenge pits each team against 

another week by week in a single 

elimination knockout style event 
at the end of a week the team with 
the most votes wins teams can also 

receive a 15 percent boost if they 

earn the judges choice award which 

the sewer mutants did last week 
if 
a team beats their opponent they 

advance to the next week where 

they will be given a new theme to 

base their next video on so far the 

team has advanced through the rst 

round out of a possible four 
in the rst round orientation 
the bozeman sewer mutants beat 

the penn state chopsuad

an undergraduate student body

quarternal round night class
prior to this competition the 
teammates were practically strang
ers alex dagostino matt wood 

seth harding jake lamons nash 

lisac jake wenzel and cole histon 

came together through a combina
tion of chance and a love of skiing 
in a last minute eort to assemble 
a team a meeting place was an
nounced for anyone interested 
whoever showed up that tuesday 

night that who was on the crew 

said wenzel the crews stoke mas

ter  from there the sewer mutants 

went straight to work
its an everyday everynight 
ordeal said dagostino the teams 

editor and cinematographer e 

nature of the competition requires 

teams to not only lm on the moun
tain but in untraditional locations 
as well commonly in urban settings
although theres pressure on 
many of the teams to stay in the 

terrain parks the sewer mutants 

want to defy expectations we aim 

for about 70 percent backcoun
try shots and 30 percent urban 

stated wood the manager of the 

sewer mutants lisac the ocial 

big stunt doer added theres 

no reason to go into the terrain

whole life despite his title on the 

team histon shares a similar pas

sion for the backcountry dont get 

me wrong 
i had a great time getting 

hot laps in on the tow rope there 

and shredding rails but the moun
tains just dont even compare he 

said montana is a whole new type 

of skiing for me and 
ive had the 

best days of my life out here 
as bold as the sewer mutants 
skiers are the 
red bull bracket 
reel is just as much about the 
cinematography as it is the riding 
lamons the designated aerial 
lmer is no amateur when it comes 

to lming extreme sports he found 
his passion for lmmaking when 
he realized that lming every little 
crazy stunt could be turned into 
a career path aer he received six 
sponsorships for his videos 
i gured if 
i could do that at the age of 
16 i could make a living out of this 

somehow he said     so here 
i am shaping my career as a 20yearold 

and shooting the sickest skiing with 
the raddest dudes in montana
no member of the bozeman 
sewer mutants could explain the 
reasoning behind their team name 
but all agreed that they love it and 
stand by it completely

parking and transportation master plan in the works
by john t
rapp
in the midst of parking woes university 
expansion and building construction a 
plan to increase parking on campus is in the 
works is plan is the parking transpor
tation master plan a 10year plan which 

assistant planner candace mastel says will 

hopefully be nalized by next september
what we are trying to do is work out 
parking and transportation as a dual rela
tionship is is as much about bikes and 
pedestrians as it is with single occupancy 
vehicles mastel said were on this verge 
of some big changes ats exciting but it 

brings with it issues about how we t every
body into the same space
one of the four goals of the plan is to re
duce the number of single occupant vehicles 
mastel hopes that this plan will inspire 

people to think outside the box she also 
wants people to think about others dont 
think about your tenure here as a student 
for the next four years but think about what 
this campus looks like in the next 100 years 
mastel referenced students who live very 
close to campus but still drive to school e 

plan hopes to encourage those commuters to 

consider the alternatives ese are people 
who can walk or bike mastel said and they 
can save themselves a lot of money ats 

money to do fun things like go out to eat 

or go on spring break trips e price for a 
regular sb pass costs 177
another goal is to protect the existing 
parking facility investments currently 
there are 33 parking spaces per 100 students 
and faculty we are trying to see with 
our future growth if the ratio should 

stay steady or should it change should it 

become more in the favor of people parking 
or more in the favor of other opportuni
ties 
currently almost all of the parking lots 
see a 100 percent utilization during class 
hours because of this people nd it very 

hard if not impossible to leave during the 
day either to go shopping or to care for 
their family moms who have family issues 
cannot go home because they cannot nd 
parking when they leave in the middle of the 

day  lots tend to ll up at 740 am and 

stay full throughout the day mastel said 
e other two goals are to enhance mobility 
for msus employees faculty students and 

visitors and to improve multimodal connectiv
ity between the campus and o campus des
tinations or to make it easier to travel about 
both on and o campus is could mean 
things like parking shuttles or bike lanes
while some may see this plan as a way to 
simply encourage people to carpool mastel 

says it is much more 
i think the important 
takeaway is that it is about options 
its not 
about denying anybody anything you have 
to be willing to make changes in your life to 

use those other modes of transportation 
but they are usually really good improve
ments in your life 
its about choices not 
about penalizing people and thats the focus 
of this plan
candace mastel can be reached with questions at
 candacemastelmontanaedu or by phone at 406 9947457
what we are trying to do is work out parking and transportation as a dual relationship 
this is as much about bikes and pedestrians as it is with single occupancy vehicles

new bystander intervention psa in progress
by dakotah wh
itingviolence occurs on and around 
campus everyday whether it be 
mental or physical violence bystand
ers are oen present according to 
statistics from the national center 

for education approximately 90 
percent of students in the america do 
not like to see someone bullied but 
less than 20 percent try to stop it 
  this typically happens from the lack of 
knowing what to do as americans in 

our culture and society a lot of times 
were taught to mind our own business 
somebody else will do something about 
our societal problems 
i want to break that 

cycle and tell people to be that person who 
stands up said joe schumacher msu 

alum educator for vo
ice center and 
staff advisor for the not 
in our house 
nioh psa
msus vo
ice center and n
ioh 
task force are in the midst of creating a 
new psa this year will be their fourth 
video and will focus around the theme 
of bystander intervention the purpose 
of this film is to show a solution we re
ally want to open up that conversation 

advocate for the vo
ice center and chair 
representative for the task force kyra mor
rissey said the past three films produced 
by the n
ioh task force have themes 
centered around awareness education and 
actionmost people have been on board 

with the fact that certain issues need atten
tion and this years psa will show people 
how to respond our organization is un
like any other because it seeks to bring to
gether students and community members 
that stand against violence this is an issue 

we can all get behind schumacher said 
the director jack murrey is a graduate 
from the film and photography depart
ment at msu 
ive known jack for a 
while we were both students here together 

so i knew the skillset he had and wanted 

him on board we love this school and it 
sends a cool message when its msu alum 
giving back 
its just bobcats taking care of 
bobcats at the end of the day schumacher 

said the actors involved are all msu stu
dents volunteering from a diverse range of 

student organizations such as the athletic 
department and greek life community 
theres about 50 volunteers involved in 
this years film all the students helping 

out have a visible presence on our campus 

and its really cool to see who comes out to 

support morrissey said 
the film itself will be shot in three 
scenes scene one will take place in the 

msu football locker room where a team
mate witnesses the bullying of another 

team member scene two will be in the 
renne library where the same team mem
ber witnesses his buddy catcalling towards 

a female student the third and final scene 
will be set up to resemble a party where a 

more serious scenario will take place after 

filming the sound will be muted and stu
dent advocate for the vo
ice center hel
ena klein will do a voiceover narration 

the scenes are meant to make the viewer 

feel uncomfortable so the importance of 

the issues are thoroughly addressed 
if it 
makes you feel uncomfortable it probably 
makes someone else feel uncomfortable as 
well morrissey said 
bystander intervention has become 
an important issue on college campuses 

because of its potential to bring aware
ness to both mental and physical violence 
these situations are unfortunate but 
its definitely real it happens all the time 
and its not cool people need to step up 
and be courageous enough to intervene 

one student actor saidthe film strongly 

focuses on the vo
ice centers three main 
steps towards prevention which are aware
ness education and action 
interpersonal 
violence has touched all of our lives and 

for that reason we all dedicate special 
attention and care to our campus commu
nity we want to show newcomers that we 
welcome everyone but that theres certain 
things we wont permit were stepping in 
to say these are our values schumacher 

said bystander intervention stems from 

education so were raising awareness that 
theres other moments that if we looked 
at the language and things we do in our 

culture that contribute to violence there 

may come a day where we wont have to 

intervene
the film is scheduled to release right in 
time for sexual assault awareness month 

in april and all are encouraged to watch 

if we can help at least one person feel 
more comfortable stepping in we will have 

reached our goal morrissey said

 john trappmsu students share love of 
 literacy with elementary kidsby jul
ie donagan
in an event organized by the msu chapter of 
kappa delta pi 
international honors society in 
education students at heckuaw elementary 
school in belgrade celebrated leap day on mon
day feb 29 by participating in leaping to 
into 
literacy kappa delta pi hosts a literacy alive 

project every february
e literacy alive projects are funded 
through the national supporting eective educa
tor development grant program ese grants 
are intended to support national nonprot 
organizations for projects that are supported by 

at least moderate evidence to recruit select and 

prepare or provide professional enhancement 

activities for teachers principals or both
according to kathryn willdubyak advisor 
for kappa delta pi asmsu student ocers 

organized leaping into literacy and over 100 
volunteers from msu helped with the event vol
unteers were drawn from the education depart
ment football team golf team and rodeo team
elementary students participated in literacy 
games in the cafeteria including parts of speech 
twister wheel of words 
rainbow 
road sight 
word walk and duck crossing a game based on 

gurative language each game was targeted for 
a specic grade level one second grade student 
named caden described his favorite game 
race 
for plurals where one player runs to get a word 
the partner writes the word in its plural form and 

the partners switch according to willdubyak 

the games were all created by students in a course 

about language arts methods for elementary 
teachers
in addition to literacy games students could 
head to the library or to a classroom for 
read 
to bobcats where they got to pick a book from 
the shelves and read it to msu student volun
teers 
if i were a little kid and had a chance to 
read to the football players 
id be all over it said 
dylan lindsley a student who got involved with 
leaping into literacy through his educational 
psychology class
for each literacy game and reading activity 
students got points on their bobcat bucks card 

which could later be used towards buying books 

at the book fair according to willdubyak this 

helps benet the school as well because the school 

earns money from the book fair
sta members at heckuaw elementary were 
happy to be a part of leaping into literacy we

rwith three majors a business 
and 27000 instagram followers 
sophomore aidan weltner is not a 
typical msu student
weltner is from boise 
idaho 
and came to msu after making a 
carefully calculated decision he 
created a weighted decision ma
trix based on 10 criteria he only 
applied to a handful of schools 

and scored them according to 

quality of life outdoor oppor
tunities size of the community 

people within the community and 
the variety of programs offered 
at school first and foremost is 

the lifestyle said weltner of his 

choice to come to msu 
he also chose msu because 
although he hadnt decided on a 

major and he was leaning toward 
business and photography he has 
since declared a double major in 

marketing and photography and 

hopes to get his degree in  directed 

interdisciplinary studies through 
the honors college which is a 

program for students to pursue ar
eas that fall outside the established 
departmental oerings
while taking terry profotas in
troductory business class during his 
freshman year weltner discovered 

his true passion for business e 

class worked with creating business 
ideas to solve problems one exer
cise was to come up with ideas for 
business ventures weltner came up 
with two ideas he wanted to pur
sue one was a gardening service fo
cused on helping people grow their 
own food another was a rideshare 

app for skiers and snowboarders
e gardening idea was used for 
the project presentation and welt
ner took his idea for the rideshare 

app beyond the class shareli an 

app that allows people to carpool 

to the ski hill has now become an 

actual business thanks to weltner 

and several team members
it was kind of a desperate plea 
being a freshman living in the 

dorms not having a car but having 

a ski pass and not wanting to waste 

days on a pass but never being able 

to nd a ride and constantly watch
ing people particularly people like 
upperclassmen going with empty 
seats in their car weltner said
he also sees several problems 
being solved through the app 
in terms of from an environmental 

standpoint from an eciency 

standpoint from a social stand
point 
i thought it would do 
really well and it kind of took o 
weltner said
weltner is in charge of the busi
ness side of things while other 

team members are in charge of 

development shareli is currently 
going into the testing stage and will 

be launched in montana utah and 
colorado
im pretty deadset on being an 
entrepreneur whether thats right 
out of school or a couple years aer 

i have a lot of business ideas 
i really 

nd the lifestyle appealing and 
i nd the risk appealing and the op
portunity to instigate change onto 

a community weltner said 
you always hear the kind of cli
ch life is built on top of failures 
kind of thing but it really is true 

and starting businesses because 

the amount of focus and eort and 
risk that you have to take to get 
something o the ground is kind 

of unlike anything else ere really 

is no security starting in a business 

and i just nd that very appealing 

weltner said about the appeal of 

risk
weltner has been a photographer 
longer than he as been a business

man having taken photographs 

since he was a kid ats been 

kind of a constant in my life for a 

long time 
i picked up a real camera 

when 
i was 12 and just tinkered 

with it for years until 
i liked the 
pictures 
i was taking weltner said 
he has interned for the montana

wonderful wolf watching in yellowstones lamar valley
by theodo
re grove
rere were ve wolves asleep at slough 
creek this morning the woman stand
ing next to me said people were walking 
right past them and didnt even notice e 
wolves barely even lied their heads up as 
people walked past she turned away and 
took another look through her spotting 
scope before continuing to retell the morn
ings events 
i took another look through 

my viewnder swiveling the camera on the 
tripod to scan the surroundings several 

stray bison lumbered through the snow 

along the other side of the road with the 

vast expanses of lamar valley encompassing 

the distance behind them 
it was a pictur
esque winter scene e gray ones moving 

again said the woman 
i turned my camera 

back around and focused on the ridgeline 

above us a large grey wolf stepped out of 
the trees and into the sun another wolf 
soon appeared beside the rst en a third 
joined the pair
wolf watching is a popular pastime in 
lamar valley tucked away in the northeast 

corner of yellowstone national park people 
travel to the lamar from all over the world

easier said than done ones best chance of 
spotting a wolf is generally to look for peo
ple sporting spotting scopes when a crowd 
gathers along the road in lamar valley it is 
oen a sure sign that something is nearby
ats what led us to stop along the 
roadway earlier that morning a small 

group of people had accumulated and were 
keenly watching something in the distance 

sure enough we were soon observing three 
wolves standing on the ridgeline above us 
two sauntered o towards the right while 

the third laid back down amongst the trees 
i watched them intently through the view
nder 
it wasnt long before more people 
arrived e side of the road was soon lined 
with spotting scopes and telephoto lenses as 
everyone anxiously tried to spy the wolves 
we quietly watched the wolves for about 
45 minutes ey were feeding on an old elk 
carcass up amongst the trees and wandering 
in and out of view ere were two sporting 
black coats while the third was gray people 
came and went and we happily helped them 
locate the wolves in their spotting scopes 
and binoculars aer some time we eventu
ally departed leaving the crowd of wolf 
watchers behind as we walked back towards 

our car a lone bison stood o to our right 

eyeing us as we walked up the road 
i pon
dered whether the bualo was aware of the 

danger that lurked just up the hill behind 

him he seemed happy enough though for

cabin fever what to do when youre stuck indoors
by n
ick kasse
rcabin fever the feeling of 
being trapped for too long in 
too small a space unable to go 

outside because its freezing and 

dumping snow spend enough 

time like this and you start to get 

a little stircrazy as we come to 

the beginning of spring here are a 

few ways to beat the last dregs of 

cabin fever
embrace the beast
we all know what its like 
to wish for spring after four 
months of winter feet of snow 

and days where you have to scrape 

ice off your windows every morn
ing you start to remember what 

its like to be able to go outside 

without wearing three shirts two 

pairs of pants thick socks gloves 

a hat and two jackets of course 

there are those people who go out 

in shorts in the middle of winter 

anyway but their blood is far 

warmer than mine will ever be 

and if youre going out in shorts 

then youre probably not getting 

cabin fever in the first place 
embrace your situation winter 
is a time for relaxation like no 

other season 
its the perfect 
excuse to spend every night on 

the couch with a blanket watch
ing netflix catch up on your 

shows catch up on emails break 

out settlers of catan or cards 

against humanity start that 

new show youve been meaning 

to watch cozy up with a cup of 

hot chocolate and crank up the 

volume
punch cabin fever 
 right in the face
for those of us without the 
shortsinwinter gene it still pays 
to take a leaf out of their book 

bundle up and go sledding  go 

ice skating go ice shing go snow
shoeing you can still enjoy the 

outdoors in winter all is not lost 

just because theres snow on the 

ground 
rent a snowmobile for a 
day have a snowball ght 
if youre 
out and about then cabin fever 

will have no real hold on you
plan for spring
this is probably my favorite 
part of winter especially now 
spring is right around the corner 
you know that threeday back
packing trip youve been thinking 

about doing winter is the per
fect time to bust out the maps and 

plan your route build your list of 

lakes to fish in the summer plan 

out your first elk hunt for the 

fall tie flies for spring part of 

beating cabin fever is remember
ing that its a temporary situation 

i know it may not seem like after 

a long winter but the changing of 

the seasons is as certain as sunrise 

and sunset
 last but not least 
 go to the hot springs
nothing helps kick cabin fever 
like steaming hot spring water 

its the most natural hot shower 
youll ever take 
its also a great 
place for a date bozeman hot 

springs is close but if you want 

the real deal go to norris or 

chico norris hot springs is 

gorgeous especially at night and 

on weekends they have live bands 

be careful on the drive up but 

spending a night under the stars 

with live music playing and snow 

coming down is an experience you 

will never forget

looking through trailers of multiple dier
ent ski icks its hard to notice a dierence 
e shots are the same  compilations of deep 

powder faceshots hucking big and twisty trick 

things on top of that the amount of helicopter 

fuel used to get each shot really makes it hard to 

vote in favor of more of the same type of shot 

despite this every once in a while there comes 

a shredtacular lm that is worth seeing 
into 
the mind produced by sherpas cinema is a 

recent one rowing it back into the days of 

uorescent onesies and when ski equipment 

received questionable safety ratings is another 

lm which in my mind grabs the title of best 

ski movie ever at is to say this lm can never 

be topped until it can which will just be awe
some enter apocalypse snow the french ski 

ick directed by didier lafound
 apocalypse snow is a threepart lm  at 
least according to the amount of parts on you
tube  shot between 1983 and 1986 giving 

a glimpse into the ridiculous minds of french 

skiers 
im pretty certain there is a plot that goes 
along with the lm but its in french and doesnt 

have subtitles so who knows however 
i do 

know that not knowing what is going on during 

the movie is part of what makes this movie so 

great while meeting the prerequisites of every 

ski lm  having huge air powder and extreme 

skiing  apocalypse snow goes far beyond such 
simple matters 
it starts out with a snowboarders 
harrowing escape from an exploding igloo 

followed by an edgeofyourseat chase down 

the mountain as he is followed by monoskiers 

in red onsies without giving too much away 

the rst part of this series includes the following 

attributes a zorb the big balls which people get 

inside and can be pushed down a hill chasing the 

snowboarder  snowblades hangliders motor
ized skis what 
i presume is the rst road gap ever 

done on lm and shredding so hard that just 

watching will make your knees hurt 
it features 
a multitude of glorious 80s era music from 

techno to classical and will ultimately leave you 

wondering what e rst segment is ideal for 

those wanting to see how much lmmakers back 

then disregarded avalanche safety with seven 

monoskiers and a snowboarder skiing through a 

massive avalanche
 e second and third segments of this 
glorious lm get a little hazy for those who 

dont understand french for some reason the 

second segment includes eld games between 

the red and the yellow team who those teams 

are 
i dont know and dont think 
ill ever 
know e competitive activities played in
clude football on a mountain skiing with mini 

hangliders pole fencing into rope swing chair 

skiing raing down a mountain pond skims 

waterbike jousting and many more activities 

ere are also episodes of pagan rituals skiing 

on re and more chasing of the snowboarder 
from the rst segment going into the third 
part of this amazingly confusing ski ick there 
is a sci element getting teleported to japan 

part of the us and what 
i can only assume is 

supposed to be skitopia things only get more 

extreme and more confusing ere is a break 

of the fourth wall getting chased by a dragon 

skiing and even more extreme air done on 
monoskis e only downside to this third seg
ment is the slight racism that comes into play 
with getting chased by

the beginning
cps opened its doors to msu students in 
1979 and at the time demand was very low
e clinic saw 662 students in its maiden year 

out of a total of 10109 individuals enrolled 

at msu e year 1979 

predated licensing 

for counseling in the 

state of montana and 

therefore there was 

only one psychologist 

and four professionals 

working at cps in 

addition there was not 

much oered outside of 

clinical services which 

included individual 

group and couples 

counseling along with 

some crisis intervention 

soon aer there was 

a push to modernize 

the services oered by 

msu at led to more 

outreach consultations 

and sta training from there cps has only 

grown when you become more visible and 

a more integrated part of the campus the 

demand for services increases pat donahoe 

director of cps pointed out
from there it was a matter of guring out 
how to meet increasing demand in the late 

1980s msu became a training center a 

graduate counseling program was created 
through the department of health and 

human development oering degrees in 

family and marriage mental health and 

school counseling according to donahoe 

this move became a cost eective way for 

cps to serve more students and a way for 

all the professionals working at cps to keep 

up to date on psychological practices and 
information
e next major 
change for cps came 

aer the mass shooting 

that struck virginia 

tech in 2007 a student 

at the university opened 

re on campus killing 

32 people and injuring 

17 others shortly aer 

the shooter committed 

suicide at this 

point addressing risk 

management became a 

more prominent goal 

of cps according to 

donahoe cps has 

taken on an advisory 

role with groups on 
campus like the behavioral intervention team 

and the safety and welfare team to address 
risk management
staff
cps boasts a sta of 11 licensed senior sta 
members and seven trainee sta members who 

include premasters postmasters and doctoral 
students to serve msus 15688 students 

we are a fun group of people we arent 

scary senior sta member betsy asserson 

who has her doctorate in psychology stated 

in comparison the 

university of montana 

also has 11 senior 

licensed counselors for 

a student body of 13358 

students 
with a total of 18 
sta members available 
nding a health 

professional that is the 

right t for students and 
their personal needs is 
the number one concern

 services 
offered
cps is free to students enrolled in at least 
six credits e number of visits depends on 
the individuals needs but on average students 

are given 10 free oneonone visits with a 

counselor last year alone cps saw around 

1300 students seeking help for various 

reasons ranging from anxiety to depression 
past trauma relationship issues and substance 

abuse according to donahoe on average it 

takes a week and a half to get an appointment
stress is a common 
reason for students to 

seek services from cps 

it is oen a precursor for 

other issues and cps 

has professionals that 

specialize in a variety of 

things including time 

management and stress 

management we want 

to provide not only 

remedial services but 

preventative services 

donahoe emphasized 

of the students who 

visit cps between 40 

and 50 percent have 
received prior counseling
besides oering personal relief individual 
counseling has been shown to provide other 

benets including increased retention rates 
according to donahoe between 94 and 98 
percent of students that are seen at cps go 

on to maintain their enrollment and work 

towards matriculation he went on to explain 
is is a resource that really facilitates 

students ability to lay the groundwork to be 

successful in life aer their career as a student
on top of individual services cps oers 
group therapy and counseling sessions e 

sessions are led by one of the professionals 

working for cps and accommodate between 

ve and eight students in the group e 

sessions are free for students regardless of the 

credit load 
cps works closely with veteran services 
on campus to provide support to soldiers 
returning to civilian life with nearly 500 
veterans on campus the services that cps 

provides for returning soldiers are well 

utilized according to donahoe cps has one 

sta member chip kern who is dedicated 

entirely to working with veterans his oce is 

located in the disability reentry and veteran 

services department
students can be encouraged to attend 
cps via referrals although the choice to 

seek help is completely voluntary parents 

students residence life faculty and sta can 

refer students to cps most oen people call 

the counseling center for a free consultation 

before ocially making a referral although 

a consultation is common it is not required 

to make a referral  of the students seen at 

cps 46 percent come in via referral while the 

remaining 54 percent come in on their own 

cognisance 
outreach
a large component of cps is their extensive 
outreach program headed by kassar last year 
the outreach program reached nearly 3000 

students on campus outreach serves as a 

way for students to seek help while remaining 

somewhat anonymous rough seminars 

forums and events put on by active minds a 
student group on campus dedicated to student 
mental health and wellness cps outreach 

program has found a niche in october 2014 

it received a threeyear federal grant from the 
substance abuse and mental health services 

administration to help with outreach and 

prevention e funds have been able to 

help develop infrastructure and boost the 

programs visibility its human to struggle 

its not about weakness its about reality 

kassar stated
in conclusion
mental health is undoubtedly a prevalent 
issue on college campuses and cps is working 
to address it head on our sta is dedicated to 

college mental health we are sensitive to the 

demands on college students asserson said 

take advantages of the resources on campus 

she concluded kasser went on to explain i 

dont think people realize how available we 

are

opinion
growing pains msu must shi focus to cultural change
msu is growing rapidly with over 
20 percent growth in the last 10 
years some strains must emerge but it 
seems the administration is flounder
ing in this influx of students 
while certain elements 
stand out the honors col
lege much of the chemical 
engineering and agricultural 

research larger infrastructure 
and growth projects are slap
dash the norm asbjornson 
innovation center na
ic 
is exceptional but it is due to 
a fortuitous gift rather than 
the foresight of the adminis

tration 
in parallel with an 
inability to hire enough faculty or build 
a climbing gym that meets demand the 

issue of transportation rears its head
according to msu news the parking 
lots are near capacity with 5121 spaces 

those displaced by the na
ic will be 
largely replaced by an adjacent park
ing garage but a new dining hall near 
culbertson displaces 100 parking spots 
to make up for this a new lot has been 
proposed near family  grad housing 
between 13th ave and 15th ave this 
seems an obvious solution but it is fal
lacious to think that diminished parking 
mandates construction of equivalent or 
more elsewhere 
according to david kack the mobil
ity and public transportation program 

manager for the western transporta
tion 
institute there are during peak 
usage hours 800 unused spaces in the 
outer parking lots msu doesnt have a 
parking problem though it will it has 
a lastmile problem the underused lots 
are the stadium lot 055 miles from 
the mall 2000 feet from gaines and 
the lincoln lot 075 miles to the mall 

05 miles to gaines the proposed new 
parking lot is 056 miles from the mall 
and 2000 feet from linfield there is no 
reason to think the new lot would be any 
more heavily utilized than these
there are many options better than 
heedlessly laying pavement an elegant 

solution is to develop a bike share pro
gram with stations at the outlying lots 
coupled with this that would be bike 
paths along where there now are none 

and a revitalized campus biking plan 
creating covered bike storage  enough 
of it  would incentivize biking both for 
people parking cars farther away and 
for purebike commuters other biking 
incentives could be outdoor 
rec center 
workshops to help students staff and 
faculty winterize their bikes the uni

versity could help create a richer walking 
and biking culture by incentiv
izing these modes of transport
while bikes are terrific the 
university should also consider 

shuttle systems the streamline 

service is effective at getting 
people to campus from a dis
tance but it has no coordina
tion with class schedules and 
doesnt help for intracampus 
transport an oncampus 
shuttle service  like that at 

the university of utah  may 
not be necessary at the moment but as 

campus expands it could be invaluable 
developing the infrastructure now could 
save money and headaches
rethinking the current parking plan 
is also worthwhile the current pass 
system merits reevaluation as it was de
veloped for a smaller university 
it makes 
very little sense for freshmen to enjoy 
parking so near to campus when they do 
not commute to class a more distant 
parking lot for those living on campus 
would free considerable space for those 
who do commute failing that more ex
pensive dorm parking passes would help 
disincentivize parking so close similarly 
the gym lot should be closed to users 

who are commuting to 
campus and reserved 
for those only using 
the gym
not all of these ideas 
need be implemented 

nor would they all 
work but the discus
sion within the msu 
administration now is 
how many new spaces 

do we need and how 
much will it cost 
it ought to be how 
can we make campus 

transportation simpler 
cheaper more environmental and adapt
able to growth
with student growth in the hundreds 
each year a 150space parking lot is 

little more than a 500000 joke 
it is a 
stopgap measure that provides nothing 

but asphalt to rip up in a few more years 
when we need another building new 
parking lots are not a longterm solu
tion cultural infrastructure is
it appears that msu is adept at physi
cal growth 
it seems unable though 
to direct cultural 
development while 

the na
ic and its 
concurrent parking 

garage will be a boon 

ultimately what we 

need is development 

that nurtures a unique 

msu lifestyle 
as a research 
university msu 

needs to be a cultural 

leader not a build
ing contractor new 

parking lots help the 

minimum amount 
of people in the least innovative way 

lets put money into projects that affect 

students lives and that will generate a 

strong culture 
it is after all what ts 
eliot called that which makes life worth 
living msu would do well to consider 
the more distant future and create a 
campus that can grow without bloating

opinion
  15the msu campus was visited on feb 
22 by the acclaimed canadian au
thor and educator 
irshad manji part of 
a series of speakers organized by msus 
leadership 
institute manji was born in 
uganda and raised in british columbia 
and grew up to become an outspoken 

advocate of 
islamic reform and 
a critic of identity politics and 
political correctness
manji touched upon these 
themes during her presenta
tion e presentation itself 

was relatively brief lasting little 
more than an hour she spoke at 
length about how fear prevents 
us from doing the right thing 

and about how her own life experiences 

informed that point of view
she elaborated on her memories of 
receiving christian and muslim educa
tions and of how after being asked to 

leave the muslim school she would 
devote time to studying her religion and 
how she often struggled with her iden
tity she shared her experiences of trying 
to promote reform in 
islam following 
the events of 911 as well as the varied 
responses she received in turn ranging 

from supportive to hateful
her message focused upon having the 
courage to insist on being told the truth 

she stated the importance of differen
tiating between allies with criticisms 
and critics who are merely judgmental 
saying that when people disagree with 

us its not always because they are on 

the other side
it was a good message and a good 
presentation
unfortunately those who had attended 
with the expectation of being challenged 

in their beliefs were probably disappoint
ed manjis activism has generally focused 
upon 
islamic reform and true to form 
her message at msu was predominantly 
related to these experiences how much 
this message challenged the city of boze
man is open for discussion it is no secret 
that most bozemanites of all backgrounds 
and creeds are willing to accept that radi
cal 
islam is a serious problem in 
need of being addressed
while her message of moral 
courage was a good example of 

leadership qualities to emulate 
it was through the leadership 
institute aer all and should be 
taken for the valuable counsel 
that it is manji missed an op
portunity to really challenge 
the people of bozeman bozeman is a city 

with strong and highlyopinionated right
wing and lewing movements both of 

which hold views that manji has histori

cally opposed
manji herself said that msu is 
about moral courage adding that it 

has a lot to teach 
ivy league colleges 
the fact that msu has moral courage 

does not mean that this campus can rest 

on its laurels it can definitely stand 

to be challenged more often manjis 
unique experiences as an entrepreneur 
a member of the lgbtq
iq commu
nity as a muslim and as an activist have 
provided her with perspectives entirely 
foreign to many students and residents 

of bozeman and while they may be 

unwelcome they need to be heard
towards the beginning of her presen
tation manji expressed her hope that 

she would return to montana when 
she does let us hope that she will be 
ready to tell us something we do not 

want to hear and that we will have as 
she expressed the moral courage to hear 
her out
in 2014 students against sexual assault 
sasa started a cuttingedge program 
to aid victims of sexual assault called the sur
vivor fund e purpose of the fund  and 
what makes it unique both in montana and 
across the country  is to provide money 

for victims of sexual assault during critical 

times to help them either get out 

of a bad situation or to make the 
process of investigation easier on 
them other colleges in montana 

and across the nation are con
tacting the vo
ice center and 
sasa about how to start similar 

programs of their own to ght this 
issue and montana states sasa 
should be applauded for being at 

nationwide forefront in combating this issue
if a victim needs to get out of an abusive 
relationship but they cannot immediately 
aord a new place to stay they can contact 
the vo
ice center help center or haven 
ese organizations will then contact the 
survivor fund board when will review the 
case within 24 hours  usually approving 

it in less than three hours  and in this 
particular case provide the 106 needed for a 
housing application that doubles as a deposit 

with family and graduate housing 
e fund can also provide support for 
victims already in the process of legal investi

gation by doing simple things like providing 

them with gi cards to replace clothes that 

were conscated as evidence is kind of 
outreach which more communities must 
adopt is crucial when dealing with domestic 

or sexual violence because it makes the victim 

more comfortable in dealing with authori
ties on the issue as well as reaching out for 
tangible support
in the short time since its inception the 
survivor fund has been able to provide 

nancial support for over 50 victims of sexual 

assault and abuse in the gallatin valley at 
this time money for the survivor fund is 
gathered through events and fundraisers run 
by sasa eir most popular event the boz
eman monologues is coming up on march 8 

e purpose of the monologues for members 
of the community to share speeches about 
sex gender relationships and everything 
in between fundraisers like the 

monologues provide a compel
ling way for the general public to 

both learn more about this issue 

and choose to get involved ese 
public events act as a way to make 
these taboo issues more under
standable as well as oering them a 
chance to be part of the solution
e original purpose of sasa 
which is one of the oldest clubs at msu is 

to raise awareness about sexual and domestic 
violence now with the survivor fund they 

are truly taking action against this epidemic 

is gives the bozeman monologues a two
fold purpose  to raise awareness about the 
issue and the money to solve it 
aryn phillips the chair of the survivor 
fund board stressed that the survivor fund 

is something that is only possible because 

of the joint eorts of students sta and the 

community who generously donates to it 
is group eort is successful because 
of the streamlined and desperately needed 

infrastructure that supports it and it is this 
infrastructure that msu is helping other 
schools start e survivor fund vo
ice 
center etc are so great because they work 

and work incredibly well when other 
schools begin to build resources like the 
voice center then they will easily be able 
to inturn create a resource like the survi
vor fund which is an incredibly awesome 
resource for any school to have 
in this sense 
msus community eort to stop sexual and 
domestic violence will have a much more 
global eect on the issue

renaming columbus day misses opportunity to learn from history
the day that christopher co
lumbus arrived in the bahamas 
was a day that irrevocably altered 
the course of history his arrival 
heralded the destruction of entire 
societies and civilizations and 
opened up the american continents 
for settlement and exploitation by 
european nations
understandably columbus and his ac
tions have attracted intense controversy for 
centuries he became both a gure of heroic 
worship as well as one to be reviled keep
ing with the spirit of the former in 1937 the 

federal government declared that columbus 
day was to be a federal holiday in celebration 

of columbus arrival in the americas
to this day the holiday remains controver
sial 
recognizing columbus brutal treat
ment of the 
indigenous peoples during his 
voyages to america many universities and 
cities have opted to rename columbus day 

in favor of 
indigenous peoples 
day with the goal of recognizing 

the mistreatment of the native 

americans at the time of co
lumbus as well as celebrate and 

examine the subsequent history 

and culture of native americans 

up to the present
proposals for the adoption of 
indigenous peoples day in boze
man and at msu were presented in january 

whether these proposals will be accepted is 

not set in stone at the moment but it pres

ents an opportunity to ponder just what the 
signicance of columbus day really is
as stated above historically columbus 
day is seen as a celebration of christopher 
columbus and his achievements even in the 
light of an increased public knowledge of his 
ruthlessness and ambition columbus is still 

regarded as a hero by some what cannot be 

denied was his pivotal role in the extinction 
of entire cultures and peoples that 

resulted from his ambitions
nor can it be denied that co
lumbuss arrival and the opening 

of the atlantic trade with all of 

its history of human miseries and 

triumphs alike forever altered the 

course of human history to ignore 

the signicance of columbuss 
voyages both in their depreda
tions of aboriginal cultures and in their 
transformation of global politics in favor of a 

more general message is to lose tremendous 

educational opportunities
nations in europe hold memorial days in 
remembrance of the holocaust and holodo
mor in order to remember the gross excesses 
of nazism and stalinism respectively ey 
have not renamed these days for a reason 
because to do so would be a grave disrespect 

to the victims columbuss name should not 

be forgotten for the same reason
nor should his impact upon the modern 
world be forgotten his arrival in the ameri

cas was truly a pivotal historical moment the 

rippling eects both of inspiring and sober
ing signicance are incalculable americans 

have been been learning the wrong lessons 

from columbus day the man was no hero 

he was one man whose ambitions and greed 

changed the world for centuries to come at a 
terrible price
we learn history in order to avoid repeat
ing the mistakes of the past vital lessons are 
contained within the story of christopher 

columbus and we would do well to examine 

them more closely when history is truly 

understood columbus day provides that 

valuable opportunity

laney lou and the bird dogs make uniquely montanan folk rock
by keegan g
rady
in the canons of music there is a 
line to be drawn between technical 
masterpieces and real music music can 

be gorgeously craed full of complex 
counterpoints harmonies and chordal 
variations but still be dropdead boring 
to listen to and then on the other 
side of the spectrum there is the music 
that speaks to the plain folk in all of us 
ese songs dont have melodies that 

require a physics degree to unravel  

they are simple enjoyable and oen 
quite loud laney lou and the bird 

dogs make music of the second kind
if youve heard the bird dogs you 
were likely at either a bar or a wed
ding ough they have played some 

impressive venues 
red ants pants 
for instance the group has largely 

remained a group focused on small 
environments and while they have 

enjoyed that aspect ddler and msu 
student brian kassay says they are aim
ing to change that bars are fun for 

dead seasons but what we really love 
to play is festivals he said e group 

has made a good start into that expan
sion  last year they were awarded 

the emerging artist award at 
red 
ants pants festival is year they will 
be playing at headwaters country jam 
as a main stage artist kassay attributes 

some of this rising popularity to their 
new promoter chicken jam west 
which recently entered gallatin valley 
eyre kicking the bozeman music 
scene into gear he said eyre not 

for the prot theyre for the music
promotion only goes so far how
ever  most of the bands popularity 

is due to their unique sound looking 
at just instrumentation and songs it 
is tempting to call them a bluegrass 
group however listening to their mu
sic that distinction begins to blur e 

bird dogs sound lacks the traditional 
atmosphere of bluegrass  it is some
times dicult to nd the traditional 

melodies in their energetic covers we 
certainly would say were more folk 
rock than bluegrass kassay stressed 
our sound is more energetic and 
more rockoriented you can hear that 

in the walls of sound the band sends

19l  callandmarksgallatin county courthouse 
off the radar but important
by sonja benton
e rst gallatin county courthouse was 
built in bozeman in 1880 the same year the 
panama canal began construction and the rst 

major developments were made to the railroads 

running through montana 
rebuilt in 1936 
the courthouse still stands on the corner of 3rd 

avenue and main street today marking one 

side of central downtown bozeman 
generally when one thinks of a court
house one pictures judges juries attorneys 

and all of the other trappings of law courts 

however gallatin county courthouse is 

not where any of that takes place 
instead 
court hearings are held in the law  justice 

center so what does take place inside the 

courthouse
e courthouse houses departments 
meetings and oces of many kinds one of 

these is the gallatin county commission 

which has been in the news recently e 

three gallatin county commissioners steve 

white don seifert and joe skinner recently 

added a new polling location on campus 

ey do a lot more than just decide polling 

locations however e commissioners de
cide on budgets county buildings and more 

ey meet 9 am on tuesday mornings in 

the courthouse community 
room on the 
third oor 
e conservation and parks depart
ment is also located on the third oor of the 

courthouse ey oversee all of the parks 

recreation and conservation programs in 

gallatin county is includes planning 

and constructing new recreational facilities 

maintenance administration of conservation 

eorts and public outreach e open lands 

board does something similar 
it seeks to 
preserve open space lands for the enjoyment 

of present and future generations is is 

separate from the conservation and parks 

department because it emphasizes preserva
tion over recreation but both work to ensure 

that the natural beauty of bozeman persists 

for generations to come 
e elections department also works out 
of the courthouse is is where one goes to 

register to vote or change ones voting address 

or name on the site myvoterpage run by 

the elections oce one can check their vot
ing status including address registration or 

the dates absentee ballots will be sent 
e motor vehicle department is hard to 
miss as it is located on the rst oor of the 

courthouse is is where one can register 

their vehicle but is not where one goes to 

do driving or knowledge tests for a drivers 

license testing for a license occurs on the 

other side of 
i90e second oor of the courthouse 
contains a miniature unocial museum of 

sorts as well ere one can see multiple 

minerals and rocks pulled from around 

gallatin county as well as models of historic 

montana buildings including tiny log cabins 

while many of these artifacts are unlabeled 

they are interesting to glance at while waiting 

for a meeting or appointment 
ere are tons of other departments 
and boards that meet and work within the 

courthouse that work on everything from 

community planning to budgets from 

airport regulations to public schooling a 

full list of meetings events and oces can be

rockies
by adam waldo
rfupon opening a national geographic 
magazine a reader is instantly bombarded by 
beautiful pictures scattered throughout the 

issue since its beginning in 1888 natgeo 

has drawn millions of readers from all over 
the world with their engaging articles and 
aweinspiring pictures aer over 100 years of 
pictures the museum of the 
rockies recently 
opened a new exhibit presenting the 50 great
est national geographic pictures of all time 
e breathtaking display came to the 
museum on friday feb 26 pictures now litter 

the display hall ranging from the classics that 

everyone has seen to unknown ones that may 
be new to viewers each picture has a brief de
scription of the story behind how the photog
rapher took the picture at just the right time 
and where the picture was taken ere are also 
ipads mounted on the wall next to each set of 
photos providing more information on each 
of the photographers who took the picture as 

well as even more stories about the pictures 

thus enhancing the complete experience
e coolest thing that some of the pictures 
have is the failed attempts of the pictures 
while the nal product is displayed proudly 
in the center of the frame there are around 

six pictures taken before the nal product was 
achieved is shows the amount of eort that 
goes into the pictures 
it adds even more to the 
quality of the exhibit 
is is one of the coolest exhibits weve ever 
had said marketing director mark 
robinson 
apart from being beautiful and breathtaking 
they come from all dierent parts of the world 
it basically gives the viewer little glimpses of the 
world 
it takes everyone on an adventure with 
every picture 
apart from the breathtaking natgeo exhib
it there is another section about a trip through 

the andes 
in across the andes hundreds of 
pictures were taken from deia schlosberg and 

gregg treinishs 7800 mile journey through 
the andes mountain range each picture is 
paired with a journal entry describing what 
they had done on their journey up to when the 
picture was taken ese photographs range 
from sensational pictures of the mountains 
themselves to the villages and people they 
found on their journey to the equipment at 
various parts of the trip treinish is a bozeman 

local so the collection has local relevance 
making it relatable for everybody
ese pictures give an incredible insight 
into the andean culture 
robinson said 
ere are pictures of children they met on 
their trip and the villages they lived in e 

pictures paired with the journal entries really 
tell a story en being able to see schlos
berg and treinishs shoes at the end of their 

journey and being able to see the wear on the 
shoes shows the amount of work that went 

into their journey
e museum of the 
rockies brought in a 
breathtaking display that is appropriate for 
all ages from being able to get little glimps

es of the world to getting to experience the 
andes with a bozeman local who will be 
giving lectures about their journey through

exhibit provides something for everyone

bozemans best sushi
by 
rolf tengd
inwhen you walk in the front doors of 
seven often referred to as seven sushi 
you might be surprised to find that it 

isnt like the other sushi places in town 
it 
doesnt try to give off a japanese aes

thetic and it benefits from it the closest 

thing they have to anything resembling 

an asian atmosphere are the traditional 

paper sliding doors to the private rooms 

the whole of seven gives of a rustic in
dustrial vibe that gives a modern spin to 

the sushi restaurant scene the main con
cern you may have is how expensive sushi 

places can be with so little food given 

to you also known as sushi syndrome 

normally this would be a problem with 

any japanesestyle restaurant but a trip at 

happy hour will leave any visitor pleas

antly surprised
while appetizers normally run around 
5 each the happy hour prices bring it 

down from to around 2 each in what 

is probably the most economical meal 

starter in the area eir best umaki roll 

starts at 13 8 at happy hour and is 

aptly named the jaw dropper an uramaki 

roll made up of crawsh cream cheese 

and mango that is tempura fried and will 

truly make your jaw drop when it comes 

to drinks seven has a phenomenal house 

sake served warm  a rare nd in the us 

let alone montana 
it goes down smooth 
as it is warm with a subtle bite that leaves 

you parched for more 
e service was spot on and while my 
drink was not always full 
i did nd the 

food was some of the fastestprepared and 

wellpresented food in the bozeman area 

topping out at a ve minute wait 
i hardly 

ever had to worry about the food sitting 

under a heat lamp before it arrived in front 

of me with the quick food you can nd 

yourself getting in and out of seven as 

quickly as you want 
in a world where other 
restaurants make you wait for a simple 

burger it really is refreshing to know that 

there is a place out there like seven where 

you can get what you want before you 

forget what you ordered
perhaps the greatest benet of seven 
however is the location e restaurant 

shares a building with 406 brewing a 

thirty minute waiting period to get a table 

got you down no problem just put your 

name on the list and pop next door for 

some homebrewed beer and wait it out 

with a cold pint of ale by the time youve 

nished a drink or two they will have a 

table ready and you are going to have an 

amazing time no matter what because 

youve already warmed yourself up for the 

sake sushi combo to ring in the night with 

a place as quick high quality and aordable 

you would easily regret not spending your 

time down at seven and missing out on 

some of the greatest sh in town
seven is located at 113 oak street 
it is open monday  saturday 1130 am  10 pm with 
happy hours all day monday and 3  6 pm tuesday  friday

barista ed
itioncoffee decoded a handydandy guide to espresso drinks
by 
isabel loos
gone are the days where the only questions 
asked in a coee shop are whether you would like 
regular or decaf and if you want room for cream 

ere are so many espresso drinks to choose from 

that it can be overwhelming especially when the 

names all sound like they should only be said in 
france or 
italy todays brewponent is here to 
eliminate that coee shop anxiety and make sure 
you can make an educated decision so you get 
exactly what you want every time
coffee and espresso
usually when someone says they just want 
a coee that means regularly brewed drip 
coee that they may or may not choose to 

add some cream to an espresso however is 

just a 30 ml shot of straight espresso so it will 

likely come in a very small cup that can be 

nished in a sip or two
macchiato
e next step up from just a straight 
espresso shot is another small drink the 
macchiato which means spotted or stained 
in this drink the espresso is stained with 
foam ere are espresso shots and then the 

rest of it is foamed milk however starbucks 

seems to have their own version of this drink 

that doesnt t the traditional description so 

dont be confused by them 
cappuccinotake it up another notch and youve got a 
cappuccino is drink is made up of onethird 
espresso onethird steamed milk and one
third foam is results in a deliciously creamy 
texture making this one of the most popular 

coee drinks sometimes it is sprinkled with 

cocoa powder for an extra special touch
latte
continuing to add more milk we get to 
the latte is is probably the most common
ly ordered espresso out there 
it is generally 
two shots of espresso and the rest is steamed 
milk simple but delicious and of course you 
can always add avor if you so desire
flat white
is is what some people call an australian 
latte e only dierence between a at white 
and a latte is that there is a thin layer of foam 

which in reality hardly changes it at all unless 

you are a serious coee snob e good news is 

when you order a at white and know what that 

means it really sounds like you know your stu
mocha
a mocha is basically a latte that is taken to 
the next level with a bit of chocolate espres
so steamed milk and chocolate are blended 
together to make a sweeter drink that will 
both wake you up and serve as a nice treat
americano
is is usually my goto drink because it is 
almost as cheap as just getting a drip coee 
but it is a little fancier 
it is just espresso shots 
mixed with water  but it tastes bold not 

watery you can add avor to make it a little 

sweeter and it is a nice option for people who 

cant drink or dont like milk
iced coffee
typically an iced coee means you will 
get a cup of drip coee poured over ice with an 
espresso shot or two mixed in so that the avor 
isnt diluted by the ice of course all coee 
drinks can be made iced which is great for sum
mertime or in my opinion all year round 
is isnt comprehensive as every cof
feehouse has their own quirks and there 

are numerous ways to customize and create 

almost any drink you could imagine but with 
this basic knowledge youll never be stuck

upcoming lm timber blends lm and timber sports
by keegan g
rady
not many people like the idea 
of chopping down trees  it 
sounds like a lot of work and 
there is a possibility there might 

be sap woodchips and maybe 

even some dirt however for 

some intrepid souls there is no 
activity more enjoyable than 
taking ax in hand and attacking 

some timber
some of those people are part 
of a group called big sky timber 

sports they are the subject 

of the upcoming student film 

timber the film will detail 

the team as they prepare for and 
compete in a competition at 
flathead community college 

the leadup to the competition 

is of specific interest of direc
tor jessica christenson a lot 
of videos you see are about the 

competition itself she said we 

want to explore what it takes to 

get there the crew will take 

the trip to flathead and also 

be present for the preparation 

leading up to that competition 

the journey will make up the 

arc of the film  from practices 

behind bobcat stadium to flat
head and the individual stories 

that inevitably come from such a 

journey
the big sky timber sports 
team is a new organization now 

less than a year old timber 

sports though are a very old 

concept which began as friendly 
competitions between loggers af

ter work the sport runs a gamut 

of professional logging tech
niques and includes some events 

that are just for fun  from saw 

skills to log running to hatchet 

throwing each discipline has a 

unique skill set similar to its 

cousin the highland games the 

sport is based in practical skill 

with an emphasis on efficiency 

and speed precision is also key 

and athletes are expected to 

perform difficult movements ac

curately all at high speed and as 

anyone who has chopped wood 

knows it also demands great 

physical strength and stamina
documentary filmmaking is 
an exercise in spontaneity as 

christenson noted no matter 

how much you plan or antici

pate what subjects are going to 

say they will say whatever they 

choose to since our subjects 

arent actors we are at their 

whim she also noted the 

difficulty of the filming itself 

calling it a very fastpaced 

process and the challenges of 

postproduction where the film 

is put together from its separate 

pieces however the obstacles 

are no dissuasion for the crew 

of timber 
i am most excited 

to show a different side of the 

sport and to understand the 

environmental aspect christen
son said the film will examine 
not only the team itself but 
the way that the sport interacts 
with nature from an ecological 
perspective logging seems to be 
a damaging action  after all 

clearcut forests are not benefi

cial to nature however the issue 

is deeply complex and the film 
promises to examine both sides 
of the problem
senior films receive no fund
ing from the school of film and 
photography  money comes 
from either fundraising or the 

pockets of the crew every crew 

member is a volunteer and the 

films generally expect to gener
ate no income 
if anyone wants 
to fund this or any other senior 

film they can be found on go
fundme and kickstarter
for some intrepid souls there is no activity more fun than taking ax 
in hand and attacking some timber

kelly matheson promotes human rights activism through lm
by dakotah whiting
today everyone has a phone in their pocket 
and therefore everyone can be a human rights ac
tivist said kelly matheson a renowned human 

rights attorney awardwinning lmmaker and 

msu alumna during her march 8 lecture work
ing to protect civilians through law matheson is 

involved with a wide range of human rights issues 

including ebola prevention climate change hu
man tracking and war crimes
matheson is a graduate of msus science 
and natural history filmmaking program and 

is the senior attorney and program manager for 

witness video as evidence a program that 

trains and supports activists to use video safely 

ethically and eectively to expose human rights 

abuse at both a national and international level 

my experience at msu set me up for success in 

my career i came to msu without a second of 

experience in lm and no experience behind the 

camera going through the program and having 

msu teach how to use lm to make a dier
ence made all the dierence for me i could not 

do it without msu matheson said 
a specic moment in mathesons life 
prompted her to combine her background in law 

with her background in lm to protect human 

rights through video every single one of us has a 

moment that moved us mine was an image from 

the amazon ere was a massive oil spill in the 

amazon and this video footage captured a man 

covered with oil in the waters of the amazon and 

he was using gasoline to rub o the oil at to 

me showed problems with health problems with 

environmental degradation and problems with 

the right to life from that moment on i knew 
matheson brought attention to the many chal
lenges and dangers brought about in the eld of 

video as evidence you have a right to freedom 

of expression and a right to freedom of assembly 
but you also have a right to personal security and 

a right to dignity oen times those rights are in 

conict with each other matheson described an 

incident in burma where a video was released by 

peaceful protesters and was taken by the govern
ment who used it to identify protesters and 

make arrests and executions a prime example of 

the challenges her program faces 
matheson explained that it is the people i 
work with and meet that give me the hope and 

the joy to continue they are the real heroes and 

the ones literally risking their lives to make a 

dierence one group in particular has stood 

out to matheson eres this group of young 

students 21 of them that are bringing legal ac

tion against the us federal government for our 

leaders failure to protect the atmosphere and 

trust for their future if they win then we all win 

because we will have won a constitutional right 

to a healthy atmosphere ese young people are 

out there advocating for our collective rights 

e court case began on march 9 
using her work in the middle east as an 
example matheson described her relation
ship with and the importance of cooperation 

between citizen journalists and public inter
est lawyers e lawyers collaborate with the 

journalists and my job is to be a bridge between 

the two journalists need to make sure they are 

collecting information safely and eectively so 

the lawyers can use it to bring perpetrators to 

justice e quality of the videos has gone up 

and my hope is to see that continue around the 

world images have power that print will never 

have she said
matheson quoted a woman she was fortunate 
enough to meet through the witness pro
gram a true listener listens with the willingness 

to help matheson asked all msu students and 

faculty to listen to each other and think really 

hard about how you can make a dierence

msu reaches performance goals 
receives all of expected 45 mil
by lilly brogger
msu will receive 45 million dollars 
in funding for successfully improving 
student performance in the last scal year 
part of the montana university systems 
general 15 million dollar fund appropria
tion from the montana legislature these 
funds are used as a strategy to increase 
the number of degrees earned on mon
tana campuses each of the eight public 

campuses in montana are eligible for a 

portion of the money 
previously from 1972 to 2014 
enrollment was the only metric used to 

determine funding beginning in 2014 
performance became 
the measure used to 
determine the portion 
of money each campus 

receives performance 
is based on how many 
students are enrolling 

in school and actually 
graduating 
performance fund
ing is an incentive for 
universities to focus 

more attention on 
helping students stay 
in school and graduate 

and less attention on 
simply getting them to 
enroll said executive 
director of university communications 
tracy ellig
each campus in montana can receive 
performance funding based on resident 

student enrollment across all eight of 
montanas campuses msu has the most 
students enrolled by a fulltime equiva
lent fte and therefore receives the 
maximum amount fte is calculated by 
adding the enrollment time of each in
state student for example four instate 
students attending quartertime would 

equal one fte 
msu has the highest fte in the 
university system with 306 percent of all 

fte montana resident students ere
fore if it reaches its performance goals 
it receives 306 percent of the 15 million 

dollar pool e university of montana 
has the second highest fte with 272 

percent of all fte montana resident 
students and therefore if it reaches perfor
mance goals receives 272  percent of the 
15 million dollar pool 
ellig emphasized that the campuses do 
not compete against each other for this 
funding e structure of the funding is 
to incentivize each campus to strive to 

improve past performance 
to get this funding msu has to show 
progress in specic metrics determined by 

the montana board of regents e goal 
is to improve retention rates increase the 
number of students who earn under
graduate degrees increase the number of 

students who earn graduate degrees and 

increase msus research expenditures 
these measures are weighted and 
indexed to determine growth target 
goals if the campus reaches this growth 
target they receive full funding if a 
campus falls below their target but only 
because of random 
nonsystematic 
fluctuations they will 
receive a portion of 
the funding also 
because of the point 
system a university 
could see an increase 
in retention rates and 
a decrease in research 
expenditures and still 
receive full funding 
e evaluation and 
funding are consid
ered each scal year 

e 45 million 
dollars msu was 
recently awarded falls into the  2017 scal 
year msus performance in the 2016 
scal year determined if msu reached its 
performance goals each scal year begins 
july 1 
performance funding is important to 
msus budget ellig explained that this 
money is not additional money from 
the montana legislature and therefore 
goes into msus regular budget it is 
simply part of our base budget if we did 
not receive our full share of performance 

funding money it would essentially mean 
a reduction in our base budget ellig said 
ellig also said that the fouryear gradua
tion rate does not factor into the funding 
graduation rates also do not account for 
student experiences and other factors 
using the absolute number of degrees 
awarded encourages us to help students 

who transfer here attend part time 
because of other obligations or drop out 
for a semester or a year as well as those 

started here as rsttime college students 
ellig said
performance funding 
is an incentive for

as medical technology advances phil 
stewart is addressing problems it may cause 
through his research as part of msus center 

for biolm engineering stewart spoke 

march 8 as a part of the provosts distin
guished lecturer series about his research 

on biolms and the infections they can cause 

around medical implant devices 
stewart received his bachelors degree in 
chemical engineering from rice university 

in texas he went on to get his masters 

degree and doctorate from stanford when 

i was starting out there were few courses 

at the intersection of biology and engineer
ing stewart stated during his lecture in 

fact the only biology education he has came 

from a plant physiology class and a bird
watching class both of which he took as an 

undergraduate aer receiving his bachelors 

degree stewart went to switzerland for a year 

to work in research and development labs 

at lonza here he worked on scaling up the 

synthesis of a pharmaceutical product using 

organic chemistry 
upon returning to the us stewart stud
ied at stanford under the lone chemical engi

neering professor channing robertson who 
at the time was doing research on exploring 

ways to use microorganisms to make high 

value products in a single step under benign 

conditions aer this time stewart received a 

national science foundation scholarship to 

go and work in a nato country he chose 

france and consequently spent time work
ing in paris as a  postdoctoral fellow stewart 

joined the sta at msu in 1991
stewart explained that biolms can be de
ned as microorganisms that group together 

in dense aggregates which makes them hard 

to kill examples of biolms include the slime 

that is found forming on the surface of a river 

rock dental plaque and certain infections 

that form around implanted medical devices 

like articial joints pacemaker leads and uri

nary catheters in catheters biolm infections 

can cause encrustation which can impede the 

catheter from doing its work and it may even 

lead to urinary tract infections
biolm infections are slow moving 
localized very persistent infections that 

form on foreign bodies or dead or damaged 

tissue which common everyday antiseptics 

like hydrogen peroxide cannot kill in fact 

hydrogen peroxide cannot even penetrate the 

microorganisms in the biolm in addition 

biolm infections can cause collateral dam
age to neighboring healthy tissue we are 

nding more and more infections tting this 

paradigm stewart said 
in stewarts current research the zone of 
compromise models the area around the 

implanted medical device that is more sus

ceptible to infections when a bacteria lands 

in this zone white blood cells also referred 

to as neutrophils get confused we dont 

know why but they dont get the job done 

stewart explained during his lecture e job 

of a neutrophil is to swarm in and destroy the 

bacteria as it is found in the body stewart 

proposed that a solution needs to be found to 

jumpstart the individual bodys own defense 

mechanisms 
as of now stewart is watching the interac
tions between neutrophils and infections 

especially when they are inoculated at the 

same time he claimed that none of his suc

cess would be possible if it were not for the 

creative teamwork he has encountered from 

the center for biolm engineering or the 

support he has found in his own collegial 

home department of chemical and biological 

engineering

the application deadline for scholar
ships offered through msus veteran 
services is fast approaching for the 

2016  2017 school year six scholarships 
totaling 16990 are available for veter
ans their spouses and their children the 
original scholarship the veterans family 

freedom scholarship was established to 

support the spouses of veterans who are 

affected by military commitments but 

dont receive the same financial support 
as veterans many spouses put their 
life on hold because of changing duty 

stations and some may continue with 

their education which means transferring 

schools multiple times losing credits each 

time said jessica sullivan  a military 

spouse and the veteran coordinator at 
disability reentry and veteran ser
vices she added veterans are thankfully 
awarded the gi bill to help with college 
tuition while the spouse usually has no 
support and has to take out loans so the 

scholarship was started to help with this 

financial hardship and provide support 
for the woman or man standing behind

by ian breuner
the bobcats were led by a 
strong performance by senior 
guard marcus colbert in his last 

home games as the cats took 

down northern colorado and 
north dakota in worthington 
arena 
montana state faced off 
against the bears of northern 

colorado on thursday march 
3 and defeated them 8163 
while it wasnt one of the most 
dazzling displays of offense that 
fans have seen the cats dis
played some tenacious defense 

that led to stops and more 

opportunities on the offensive 

end northern colorado scored 

first but the cats were able to 

answer and went on a 100 run 

to take a 102 lead early in the 

first half the bears crept back 

however and took a 1715 lead 

at the 1013 mark the cats had 

the last laugh of the first half 

outscoring the bears 144 in the 

final four minutes of the first 

half the bobcats led at inter
mission 4228 they held the 

bears to just two points in the

ing racking up a gamehigh 24 
points freshman guard tyler 
hall also contributed 21 points 
the cats forced 15 turnovers on 
the game and scored 17 points 
off of turnovers i thought 
it was our prettiest defensive 
game msu head coach brian 
fish said the bobcats shot 917 
percent from the charity stripe 

nailing 22 out of 24 i thought 

we were aggressive tyler did a 

good job penetrating and thats 

important for him to counter 

what defenses are doing to him 

fish said i just thought it was a 

better effort tonight in terms of 

playing aggressive as a team 
the bobcats took on the 
fighting hawks of north da
kota on saturday march 5 and 

emerged with the 8982 victory 

colbert was a force to be reck
oned with from the start of the 

game he scored 11 of the bob
cats first 13 points of the game 

helping to establish an early 139 

lead the cats established their 

largest lead of the half at the 
732 mark leading 2815 before 
the fighting hawks managed to 
cut the lead to single digits head
ing into the half at the start 
of the second half the bobcats 

went on a 158 run to take their 
largest lead of the game the 
bobcats led by 15 points ahead 

5439 the hawks would not 

go down quietly however and 
at the 819 mark cut the lead to 
single digits as the game came 

down to the wire the hawks 

cut the lead to six with 052 left 
on the clock colbert hit three 
of four free throws in the final 

minute along with sophomore 

zach green and junior quinton 
everett each hitting one to lift 
the cats above the hawks 8982 

colbert finished with a remark
able 29 points three assists and 
three steals in his final game 
in worthington arena senior 

danny robison was limited 
because of foul trouble but even 
with only playing 13 minutes 

the senior posted five rebounds 

an assist and a block 
i cant thank these guys 
enough for what theyve meant 

to this program fish said the 

bobcats finished the regular

sky conference play
both bobcat basketball teams lose in reno tournament
by davis connelley
for the bobcat men and women the 
road to march madness ended prematurely 
though expectations differed for each the 

men and the women both lost in their first 

game of the big sky conference tourna
ment in reno nevada the men entered 

seeded seventh in the conference and the 

women had the top seed
on tuesday march 8 the men faced 
the 10th seeded sacramento state hornets 

in the first round of the tournament the 

men despite beating the hornets twice in 

the regular season couldnt find an answer 
for sac state senior cody demps who 
missed the first two contests the bobcats 
shot horribly from beyond the arc only 

connecting on 6of28 attempts but still 

only lost 7975
freshman tyler hall led the cats in 
scoring shooting for 17 points and pulling 

down 8 rebounds and senior marcus col
bert in his last game as a bobcat scored 

15 sac states justin strings led all scorers 

with 25 points 
the loss puts the cats at 1417 for the 
20152016 season msu head coach bri

an fishs second only losing two players 

to graduation the bobcats look positioned 
to make a deeper tournament run next 
year but will need to replace the leadership 
shown by colbert and fellow senior danny 

robison
the women earned a firstround bye in 
the tournament due to their regular season 

conference championship but ultimately 

met the same end as the men the cats 

squared off against idaho state wednesday 

afternoon march 9 the women led nearly 

the entire game but failed to put enough 

distance between them and the bengals in 

the end and isu stunned the cats with a 

last second threepointer to steal the vic

tory from the bobcats 5250 
doomed by poor free throw shooting 
the cats lost despite having the big sky 

conference mvp newcomer of the year 

and coach of the year in senior jasmine 

hommes junior riley nordgaard and 

tricia binford respectively junior reserve 

peyton ferris led the cats with 16 points 

off the bench and hommes contributed 10 

on 4of19 shooting
the bobcats will have a tough time re
bounding from the loss graduating a num
ber of important seniors however binford 

signed a threeyear contract extension after 

the regular season so the cats will continue 

to have a top tier coach to rely on

championship win at the conference meet 

and set a new school record 
it was pretty cool breaking the record 
i had been aer it for a while i had gotten 

really close two years ago and so its been 

something ive been wanting to do before 

i leave msu e weekend before i nally 

broke it once again i was super close to it 

so i knew that that next meet was my last 

chance schmitz said if it wasnt enough 

to have her name in the record books she 

nished her indoor season as a big sky 

conference champion winning the 800m 

with a time of 21396 
for schmitz track is not just about 
breaking records and winning races its also 

about creating the longlasting relation
ships with her teammates eres been 

so many awesome teammates and their 

personalities make it really fun to come out 

here every single day theres perky person
alities and lots of outdoor personalities my 

roommate is also on the team and we really 

like throwing pasta parties and having the

growing up in rock island illinois bobcat 
basketballs freshman star tyler hall was 
used to competitive basketball e allure of 

playing basketball started at a young age  his 

father and mother both played basketball at 
augustana college in rock island for hall 

basketball has always been his passion  both 
parents played so ive been around basket
ball since i was born i just have always been 

pushed to be better having parents that know 
what to say its not always what i want to hear 

but what i need to hear 
aer being a twotime allstate choice 
at rock island high school averaging 173 

points 47 rebounds and 35 assists a game 
during his senior year he was recruited by 
more than a dozen division i programs 
again hall looked to his parents for what he 
needed to hear and their advice was to look 

for a university that made him happy and 

comfortable in order to meet those charac

teristics he rst looked for a coach that made 

him feel that way and found it in msu head 

coach brian fish i built a good relationship 

with coach fish and then being a laid back 

person i looked for the same in a university 

and aer visiting montana state i felt it was 
a perfect t hall explained
hall is the rst high prole recruit for fish 
as he attempts to rebuild the basketball pro
gram when coach fish came here there was 
a plan in place which is to turn the program 

around at is something that i wanted to 

do coming from a smaller aau team i just 

wanted to play for a team that is underrated 

i wanted to be with a good group of guys 

that can beat the bigger 
schools e plan for 
improvement has already 

shown progress with an in
crease in record from 723 

last year to 1416 this year
halls freshman season 
has gone even better than 
expected instantly show
ing o his ability to score 

against hawaii with 15 
points each game he has 

improved averaging 321 

minutes 192 points 52 

rebounds and 17 assists 

im just trying to learn from every game every 

situation possible i have great teammates 

around me that have condence in me which 
builds my condence in me and coaches and 
people that are looking out for me i just sur
rounded myself with positive people that help 
me with my game 
so far the positive energy seems to be work
ing especially when hall dominated against 
southern utah scoring a career high 36 points 
making ve threes and was mentioned in a  
sports center highlight while hall was the 
centerpiece of the highlight 

he keeps the team in mind 
aer going from winning 

seven games last year to 
being on espn this year is 
a pretty big step its big for 
the school and our team
when the stage gets big
ger hall thrives he showed 

that ability playing against 
the university of montana 
when he scored 17 points 
in the rst matchup and 30 

in the second hall looked 
at ease despite the pressure that comes with 

the brawl of the wild it appears that stellar 
performances on the big stage is something 
msu can get used to as hall continues his 
career as a bobcat

no snowmobile try skiing fairy lake the oldfashioned way
by theodore grover
ere is a certain stigma that comes with 
skiing the northern bridger mountains 
during the heart of winter its that you cant  

not without a snowmobile to tow one up 

there at least accessing terrain in the north
ern bridgers is chalked up to be too dicult 

and too far to attempt without a snowmobile 

that can schlep ones butt up to fairy lake 

is commonly perpetuated lore is rarely 

challenged and generally accepted its also a 

load of crap
accessing the terrain around fairy lake 
without a snowmobile is not only possible 

its actually not nearly as arduous as its 

cracked up to be most people look at the ve 

mile approach from the parking lot to fairy 
lake proper and simply write the idea o 

altogether accepting that the stigma is true 

its just too far to skin a ve mile approach 

would be dicult under most circumstances 

but the skin to fairy lake is a little dierent 

for one thing its mainly at the whole way 

to the lake and there isnt much in the way 

of signicant elevation gain secondly its 

a packed down road skinning doesnt get 

much easier than that
e other day i rearmed my opinion re
garding this matter my friend and i brought 

my younger sister along with us for a tour 
up to fairy lake with intentions of skiing 

the great one my sister was visiting from 

vermont and had barely skinned anything 

all season and yet even she could handle the 

approach without much diculty aer a 

two hour skin at a leisurely pace we found 

ourselves standing at the base of the great 

one it was not an overtly dicult skin and 

certainly not the march of death many seem 

to regard it to be so why do people treat it 

as such
rumors once established are dicult 
to dispel is sentiment holds true for the 
fairy lake skin i too used to accept that 

it was probably too far to skin to lines in 

the northern bridgers that it wasnt really 

possible without a sled en one day i went 

out and gave it a shot and realized that it 

wasnt that bad exploration is the essence of 
backcountry skiing and it would be silly to 

not give something a try just because people 

claim its too dicult so if you happen to 

be on the fence about skinning to fairy lake 

give it a go depending on the nal destina
tion one might even nd that there are ways 

to shave mileage o the approach but that 

too is knowledge that will only come with ex
ploration so the next time you nd yourself 

searching for something dierent to skin to 

try skinning to fairy lake you wont know if 

you dont go
an open letter your skis arent the problem bro
by parker webb
to whom it may concern

 
your skis arent the problem 
bro its not their fault you didnt 

stick that landing that you went 

tomahawking down flippers the 

other day and how could it be 

eyre only skis a couple hundred 

dollar pieces of wood waxed bet
ter than a hippie at a drum circle 

inanimate dead trees full of various 

graphics why blame them its 

not like they are deliberately trying 

to screw you out of impressing the 

gapers going to go shred south 

bowl what about all the times that 

theyve been there for you when 

they didnt get a core shot despite 

your pathetic path choice through 

that gully early season when they 

gripped on the icy face where a fall 

would have been truly traumatic 

your skis arent the problem bro
 jerry the conditions arent the 
problem you say that theyre the 

reason that you took that fall  if it 

had just been a bit soer a bit more 

corn you wouldve gturned out 

of there like a falcon pulling out 

of a dive please lets get real here 

e true skiers the ultrahardcore 

shredders have skied that run in 
all variable conditions one is not 

judged on how they ski in great 

conditions but rather how they 

fare in the unknown the sloppy 

the choppy of all runs whats stop
ping you from joining the masses 

of people that shred in style down 

the gnarly e conditions have 
nothing to do with it lets get zen 

here one must mold themselves to 

the run instead of molding the run 

to themselves at double black 

may ski like a charm in waist deep 

powder but waist deep powder 

today is not respect the run and 

the run will respect you
gaper your goggles are not the 
problem dont have the right 

lenses for today neither did 

glen plake when he skied all over 

chamonix in sunglasses neither 

did the norwegians when they 

invented skiing over 8000 years 

ago im pretty sure goggles didnt 
even exist back then and yet they 

went skiing why cant you erik 

weihenmayer has never com
plained about what ski lenses hes 

used eres a good chance your 

goggles let you see a fair bit better 

than whatever mr weihenmayer 

is using since hes blind  and 

has probably skied that run you 

tomahawked down
your gopro wasnt the problem 
dudeski you were too worried 

about if the red light was ashing 

and too worried about it rattling 

around that it could fall o your 

helmet you should have been 

more worried how ridiculous you 

look with a tiny square protrud
ing from your head lets leave the 

lming to the professionals you 

know the ones who dont com
plain about their goggles the con
ditions their skis e ones who 

accept why they fall who laugh it 

o and get back up who dont sit 

there making excuses looking for 

attention
your skis arent the problem 
bro youre the problem you 

frenchfried when you should have 

pizzaed
 
yours truly

and the art of bait shing
ere is an art to bait shing the art of 
patience and the art of relaxing it is not just 
the ability but the desire to sit by a river and 
listen to the water the ducks and the pika 
eres nothing like putting a squiggling 
wriggling dirtcovered worm on a hook to 

get you in touch with the simple things in 
life what i love most about bait shing is 

how it simplies everything once you are 
all weighted and baited and riggedup and 

waiting your world shrinks and crystallizes 
for a time there is nothing but you and the 

water you dont worry about your problems 
because youre too busy watching your bob
ber and in the time you watch your bobber 

you oen nd that your problems have sorted 

themselves out 
bait shing can be some of the most enjoy
able shing in the world it requires very little 
skill but a great deal of patience and a com
fort with yourself people used to distrac
tions nd that not having them has become 

distressing to many peoples psyche when 
was the last time you came home from work 
and sat in your house without any distrac
tions from your own thoughts and feelings 
no tv no phone no computer no music 
no npr no internet bait shing is about 
being with yourself without distraction and 
without lter it is every bit as centering as 
the deepest of meditations and i nd it far 
more helpful for solving my problems pro
viding you are properly equipped 
e most important thing you need for 
bait shing is the proper frame of mind you 
must be prepared to sit still for hours with 

no sh with not even a nibble and still enjoy 
your time of course you must bring a sh
ing rod and hooks and baits and weights but 
you also need a spot with a good rock or stick 

or tree trunk to wedge your rod in so a big 
sh doesnt pull your rod out to the middle of 
the river you need a suitable backrest or seat 
ideally both and nally you need a hat 
you should always bring a hat with you on 
shing trips as it has multiple uses for any 

sherman one of my absolute favorites being 
its talent for shielding your face from the sun 

when the bait shing is slow and ive been 
up since ve in the morning ill clip a little 

bell to the end of my rod to let me know if a 
sh bites ill keep my rod in place by putting 
a heavy rock on the end of it ill kick back 
and relax use my backpack as a pillow and 
tip my hat forward over my eyes e sun will 
shine down on my body so theres no need 
for a blanket i feel a warmth and an inner 
peace that the dalai lama himself would be 
envious of and i slip into a peaceful dream
less sleep
i wake up a little later and check my 
bait no bell ringing and nothing has been 
moved no bites but thats okay bait sh
ing is not really about shing anyway its 
about listening listening to the water and 

listening to the peace and quiet that comes 
from the simple but irrevocable knowledge 
that the river will always ow e river has 

been there since long before you were born 
and it will be there long aer you die even 
when you leave it it will be there when you 

come back

 feature
e army rotc program began at msu 
in 1896 only three years aer the university 
was established starting with only 40 

members the program was led by professor 

william m cobleigh the rst professor 

of military science from the onset of the 

spanishamerican war in 1898 until 1916 

there was very little instruction in the military 

department aside 

from rotc 

band in 1916 the 

national defense 

act was signed 

and designated 

msu as a senior 

rotc unit host 

and was detailed as 

a branch infantry 

rotc unit at 

this time all able

bodied young men had to complete a twoyear 

basic rotc course prior to graduation from 

msu on aug 1 1952 air force rotc 

afrotc detachment 450 was ocially 

organized and activated at msu in 1964 the 

rotc vitalization act allowed for scholar
ships for deserving cadets in rotc and no 

longer required the basic two year rotc 

course of all male students 
a students reasons for joining rotc can 
be deeply personal my brother enlisted in 

the air force back in 2011 i was in high 

school at the time and when i saw him 

graduate it was kind of my rst exposure to 

the military and its benets cadet wing 

commander of afrotc kyle schuster said 

i saw how it impacted his life so positively 

within a very short amount of time and so 

that kind of inspired me to take the same 

route however at the time i already knew 

i wanted to go to college so i was at a point 

where i wanted to go to college but i also 

wanted to serve at the same time i found out 
about the rotc program and decided to 

join
schuster a senior majoring in business 
marketing sees a benet in the ability to serve 

ones country while still attending school 

and working on an education his view is 

shared by many other cadets naomi faith 

a freshman in army rotc said i decided 

to join rotc because i have basically always 

wanted to serve in the military its just one of 
those things that 

i think every able 

person should do 

but during high 

school i realized 

that i also really 

wanted to pursue 

a career in nursing 

and rotc was 

a great way to get 

the leadership and 

army experience 
that ill need for the military while also 

getting my nursing degree so once i graduate 

i can do both military and nursing at once
although many students in the rotc 
program do not receive scholarships others 

have their tuition paid for by the us 

military in exchange for military service aer 

graduation scholarships cover full tuition 

and mandatory fees for both resident and non

resident tuition as well as a book allowance of 

600 per semester and a monthly stipend of 

approximately 300500 to defray the cost 

of living for army rotc in exchange for 

this scholarship students are required to sign 

a contract with the secretary of the army that 

they will commission to serve on army active 

duty national guard or army reserves upon 

degree completion and serve in the military 

for a period of eight years e requirements 

for air force scholarships are similar
cadets in their rst two years of the rotc 
program who are not receiving scholarships 

have no military obligation aer graduation 
providing an opportunity to rescind once 

cadets enter advanced courses in their third 

year however they must sign a contract to 

serve as an ocer following training because 

members of rotc have such rigorous 

training both in military theory as well as 

leadership cadets who graduate from a four

year rotc program can be commissioned 

into the military as a member of the national 

guard military reserves or an active duty 

2nd lieutenant e designation of 2nd 

lieutenant is the lowest ranking ocer in the 
military but as a commissioned ocer ranks 
higher than enlisted personnel who enter the 

military through an entirely dierent process 

when a freshly minted ocer joins the group 

of soldiers or airmen they are to command 

they are oen paired with an experienced 

sergeant an enlisted noncommissioned 

ocer although the relatively inexperienced 

2nd lieutenant will hold sway over a group 

of enlisted personnel and their sergeants 

the relationship begins as an educational 
formality for the lieutenant building the 

ocers ability to command competently
roughly a quarter of cadets who graduate 
from the afrotc at msu commission 

into highlydesired positions in the air force 

becoming pilots navigators and air battle 

managers two graduates from msu have 

gone on to become lieutenant generals the 

secondhighest ranking position in the air 

force 
rotc programs at msu including both 
the air force and army units are among 

some of the best programs across the country 

in october the msu army rotc sent 

four personnel and one cadre member to the 

army tenmiler in washington dc where 

the team placed third for rotc programs 

behind only florida state and west point 

military academy out of approximately 70 

programs represented last april the army 
rotc sent two teams to the bataan death 

march 32 mile race in white sands missile 

range in new mexico participants have to 

carry 35 lbs of nonperishable food on their 

back throughout the race and at the end all 

the food is donated to local food banks both 

msu teams that participated in the march 

placed rst in their respective divisions 

cadets are also expected to maintain high 

gpas based on spring 2015 gpas air force 

det 450 had an average gpa of 3262 which 

ranked them in the top 26 percent nationally 

det 450 is ranked in the top third of air 

force rotc programs nationally in physical 

training according to hugh most of the 

army rotc cadets will graduate with a 

gpa above 35 and all cadets will graduate 

in four years unless they are disenrolled for 

misconduct
since beginning in 1898 with 40 members 
the rotc program has grown to a size of 

approximately 110 members in the army 

rotc and 70 in the afrotc although 

rotc is under the college of engineering 

cadets are in majors from across campus and 

from across the country because the members 

of rotc represent the us military on 

campus they are held to a very high standard 

of behavior hugh explained cadets live 

in a glass house msu rotc wants to set 

a good moral example with superb values if 

a cadet behaves inappropriately such as being 

arrested getting a dui or having their face 

negatively on the cover of the chronicle 

hugh said they will be disenrolled and have 

to pay back any tuition fees that were paid 

for faith explained rotc cadets are held 

to a stricter standard than a regular college 

student if we get caught with any underage 

drinking drugs or anything not only do we 

face legal repercussions but also the possibility 

of getting kicked out of the program for a lot 

of us this means the loss of a scholarship and 

the end of the career we wanted being held 

to a higher standard means that rotc cadets 

can grow their personalities in many ways 

schuster said e main advantage i see in 

rotc is that it provides such a massive learn
ing experience  its an amazing opportunity 

to grow your leadership potential regardless 

of what your job will be when you graduate 

a few things i and many other cadets have 

learned throughout the program is a much 

greater sense of leadership self motivation 

self discipline and accountability for oneself
rotc a standard of excellence since 1898
rotc is perhaps one of the most misunderstood groups on campus many students do not even know what rotc stands for reserve officers 
training corps what is important to understand is that members of rotc are first and foremost regular university students students that have on

 13from thetrying for transparency changes 
coming to the opinion section
there are a few changes coming 
to the opinion section over 
the next few weeks and i want to 
keep you the readers as informed 
as possible 
  youll notice this week that were 
each writing under our own 
column signatures and in an eort 
to be more transparent for our 
readers weve also included brief 

biographies at the close of each of 

our columns historically the best 

opinion columnists at the expo
nent have also been catalysts for change  

specically the improvement and betterment 

of the world around them ey dedicate as 
much time as they can to this job all the while 
actually going out and nding things to care 

about and become involved in 
ats just the type of person who takes the 
time to do this job  and thus you can expect 
biases from us our biographies included at 

the end of each column will bring those biases 

to light and allow you the reader to under
stand the perspective that youre reading 
as journalists particularly 
opinion columnists were charged 
with speaking out about issues on 
our campus that we feel should be 

brought to light while techni
cally a paid job i hope for this 
to be much more than just a 

job for both my writers and our 
community i strongly believe we 
have a responsibility to go out and 
nd relatively inaccessible information and 
present that information in a way that is both 
accessible and benecial to our readers 
e opinion section provides us with a 
unique opportunity to present information 

within the newspaper were not expected to 
be unbiased but were also then accountable 
for our opinions ats where you the read
ers can help us do our jobs better i ask our 
readers dont turn the page if you see a bio 

that you arent inclined to agree with instead 
take that as an opportunity to read their argu
ments more thoroughly and send in feedback 
on the points with which you disagree
please if you take anything away from 
this longwinded explanation take away the 

opportunity to interact with us we welcome 
criticism and can only do our jobs eectively 
when were serving a community that holds 

us accountable for this reason weve also in
cluded our contact information at the close of 

our columns let us know when we mess up 

dont do enough research or fail to consider 
all sides 
e exponent is a unique publication in 
that were run by the students for the students 

were an independent organization and essen
tially dont answer to anyone on campus except 

our readers is is for a purpose  so that 
were also free to criticize our student govern
ment or our university when they misstep 
is also presents us with a massive chal
lenge we are learning on the job doing our 
best to become journalists overnight with no 
prior professional training we have a profes

sional advisor and publication board to help 

guide us in this learning process but the best 
way to learn is to make mistakes 
if were going to comment on the impor
tant stories its going to be hard e bottom 

line is that were proud of our university and 
value the opportunity to study here as such 

we want to do our best as student journalists 

to serve this community and make it the best

e article fight for choice neglected 
the perspective of some of us it is fair to say 
that martha stahl believes that womens 

health is always a priority i can see that some 

women might need an abortion because 

their life is in danger but there are those of 

us who also focus on the fetus
we can see that an embryo is human tissue 
not a cancer not a blob in fact with modern 

technology we can see direct pictures that a 

12week fetus has a head with a mouth mak
ing sucking motions arms and legs we can 

see with our own eyes a humanoid creature 

that will jump when poked that gets killed
do not expect those of us to see that to 
contemplate life and death yet sit on our 

hands smiling and accepting if this was 1851 

and your people were lynching a black person 

would you just go with the mob and say that is 

just the way it is the people have spoken
no we see what we believe is an injustice 
and speak out send signals most of us are 

not ghting planned parenthood we are 

sending signals that there is not a good road 

ahead when it oers abortion on demand

come say hi
it is a big election year every day 
brings news about bernie sanders 
riding coach donald trumps com
mentary on his hand size ted cruzs 
migrating booger and the feminism of 
voting for hillary clinton it is a lot 

to handle but exciting to 

watch local government 
just doesnt make headlines 
as a result citizens forget 

just how much local elec

tions impact them 
millennials oen use 
the excuse that their indi
vidual votes wont make 
a dierence however 

through voter registration organiza
tions like forward montana founda
tion impact local and even nation
al elections all the time while the 

tendency for people to hyperfocus 

on the presidential elections is valid 

and everyone should participate in 
those local elections oen result in 
more immediate results in the com
munity and single votes have a huge 

impact on the eventual outcome
members of the local government 
such as county commissioner steve 

white bozeman mayor carson 
taylor and montana state senator jp 
pomnichowski agree that voter and 

government representative diversity 
allows for better governmental poli
cies pomnichowski quoted a popular 
political slogan government is run 
by those that show up specically 
those who show up to the polls 
white stated in montana you 
have a voice many local 

montana elections are 
decided by less than 50 
votes which in itself insists 
that each vote is stun
ningly relevant further 

pomnichowski said that by 

not voting you have given 
others the power to make 
your decisions for you 
white spoke about his experience 
with county commission meetings 

which are held at 9 am on tuesday 
mornings i always take into special 
consideration when someone comes 
up to speak at those meetings and 
is nervous at means that they care 

enough about the issue to show up 
and be uncomfortable e county 
commission always opens the oor 

for public comment  which means 
everyone has the right to voice their 
opinions on any agenda item is is 
especially important since the commis
sion does make decisions that directly 
impact msu students and community 
members every single week
getting involved  and even 
voting  isnt always a comfortable 
experience it can be dicult to put 
oneself out there or even to feel in
formed enough to get involved all of 

montanas local government entities 

record their meetings e minutes 
agenda items and even videos and 
recordings can be found archived 
online montana is one of the most 
transparent governments within 
the us thanks in part to the open 
meetings law it may seem daunting 

at rst but it can also be fun to feel 
like one is part of the change 
no matter what citizens and 
especially young citizens should 
get involved on any level they can 

particularly in montana and local 
government everyone has a voice and 
therefore everyone can make change 
even if being an informed voter is all 
you have time for do that pomnich

in order to be more accommodating for 
lgbtqia students reslife has been 
working with the ueerstraight alliance 
qsa to reform the current hous

ing application process is is a 

highly progressive move that will 

create an overall more accepting 

and happy community at msu 
because it shows that the student 
voice matters and that the admin
istration is more than willing to 

reform the current system for the 

sake of student welfare 
is reform originated from a vepart set 
of demands that qsa sent to president waded 

cruzado the last of which demanded that 
options be included on the reslife housing 
application that allowed students to ask if their 
potential roommate would be willing to room 

with an lgbtqia student 
alex paterson the president of 
qsa said at msu it is clear that 
we are far behind in serving queer 
and trans students however reslife 
has been pragmatic in nding solu
tions for queer and trans students 

paterson and qsa have been work
ing closely with je bondy associate 
director of reslife in order to get 
their crucial demands implemented 
working with reslife has been successful 
and we are already seeing change happen in the 
dorms paterson said 
reslife is responding to these matters as 
quickly as possible while i regret that we were 
not able to develop an approach prior to our fall 

application going live in october 2015 we will 
have an updated application process in place for 
2017 bondy said and reslife is still doing its 
best for students coming in next fall assistant 
director james tobin will work with students 
on an individual basis to address comments 
and concerns bondy said which will provide 
a temporary solution until the more permanent 
x is put in place in 2017 
while reslife is being incredibly active 
in addressing the concerns qsa presented 

to them the other four demands are strug
gling to get past the red tape as of right now 
cruzados oce will not hold a meeting with 
qsa to discuss implementing these demands 
e logic is there because they do not want 

to set a precedent for other clubs to do the 

same which could arguably allow less serious 
issues reach the top however this is an issue 
that may need to set precedent and as pat
erson put it ueer students dont feel like 

this is a campus where they can thrive they 
are just trying to survive msu needs to be 
willing to hear all these demands if they want 
a truly accepting community

compared to the age of the univer
sity the msu leadership institute 
msuli is fairly young at 19 years old 
despite that the msuli has made a huge 

impact on campus by living 

up to their mission statement 

inspiring msu students to 

become leaders who serve as 

catalysts for positive change 

e msuli has and continues 

to have inspiring speakers come 
to the university to give students 
and sta a dierent perspec

tive on life being a ourishing 
leader in todays society is not 
always as easy as it seems so they also 
provide leadership trainings camps work
shops and mentorships all these eorts 

go to show how the msuli truly benets 

the msu campus and promotes positive 

change among students and sta
e easiest way for students to get 
involved with the msuli is through their 

mentorships during which one gains the 

title of student associate student associ

ates seek to help students realize that they 

are stronger than 
they think have 
more power than 

they realize and 

that everyone has 

leadership poten
tial some just need 

help tapping into it 

another easy way to 

get involved with a 

bit less commitment 

would be to attend 

the master classes 

and trainingswork
shops which is what 

the msuli will be 
focusing on in the 
future workshops 
provide an intimate 
space for students to interact with other 

students striving to better their leadership 

skills ese workshops also have a hands

on learning atmosphere where students can 

face what is hindering their progression as 

a catalyst for positive change e speakers 

that are brought in are considered by many 

to be the icing on the cake while they 
are very valuable experiences in leadership 
growth they do not do as good of a job at 

connecting students to their peers or com
munity when students attend these events 
all they do is sit in a chair and 

listen to someone speak rarely 
do students get to interact with 
the learning being presented to 

them which is something directly 

provided by workshops while 
speaker events are awesome the 
msuli has so much more than 

that to oer this campus 
if a student does take on 
the role of student associate they wont 

be given a typical list of stagnant day

today responsibilities that only seem 

to change with advancement within the 
oce instead student associates within 
the msuli change responsibilities as to 

experience each struggle and challenge 

that comes with each part of the oce so 

that they may grow and determine their 
strengths by doing so students are able to 
serve as the catalysts for positive change 
that the msuli 

pushes them to be
e msuli has 
many unique attri
butes that continue 
to show how this or
ganization is a huge 

asset to the msu 

campus with their 

mission statement 
the abundance of 
leadership advance
ment opportunities 

and thought provok
ing speakers it be
comes very apparent 
that the msuli will 
be changing the face 
of our campus in a 
positive way for many years to come

honor societies are not the 
only answer for networking
without any prior knowledge it 
would be easy to wander around 
campus and see the words pi kappa phi 
on a poster and assume they are related to 
greek life e same goes for 
tau beta pi and alpha pi mu 
however they are not fraterni
ties or sororities but are in fact 
student honor societies just 

three among several on msus 
campus msus honor societ
ies are chapters representing 
national sometimes interna
tional organizations many 
students will receive emails from 
one honor society or another hoping to 

recruit them promising membership and 
accompanying benets
students new and otherwise oen ask the 
same questions about honor societies what 
exactly is an honor society how does one 
become a member aer receiving emails 
from six separate honor societies which one 

is the right one to join perhaps the most 
pressing question is whether a student should 
even bother joining one in the rst place
ere are certainly incentives to join 
a campus honor society among them 

prestige resume building scholarship 

opportunities and skillbuilding probably 
the most important incentive however is 
the opportunity for networking as the age 

old adage goes it is not what you know but 
whom you know
ere is no doubt that honor societies 
provide excellent opportunities for network
ing to take place especially when a student 

joins an organization focused around their 
own major is gives students an oppor
tunity to network with professionals and 
peers with career goals similar to their own 
and creates the ideal environment for these 
interactions to take place
at being said joining an 
honor society will not guarantee 

networking opportunities any 
better than those found else
where whether it be in adviser 
meetings in classes over lunch or 
in lessprestigious clubs students 

should be investing in these op
portunities every day whether 

it be on a casual recreational or 
professional basis ten years down the road 
some people may nd that a genuine friend
ship with one of their teachers is worth 
more than a dozen meetings with industry 

professionals who might not remember 
their names ve minutes aer the fact heck 
some of the best opportunities for network
ing may even come while eating lunch with 
your weird group of friends
e takeaway message is that when 
seeking networking opportunities joining 
an honor society is not the silverbullet 
answer ey are an incredible resource but 
they cannot substitute for basic networking 

skills what you put into honor societies is 
what you will get out of them

beauty and the beast turns 25 its place in disney history
by kaycee cronk
a tale as old as time turns 25 this year 
beauty and the beast an undeniable 
classic in the disney pantheon is a rich 

film that represents a high point from one 
of the greatest eras of disney filmmaking 
but to understand its place diving even 

further into the past is necessary
disney scholarship is a wonderful thing 
that actually exists and academic study 

of the nowsprawling company has led 

to the widelyaccepted establishment of 

defined periods in disney history one of 
the most notable periods is referred to as 
the disney golden age which extended 

from 19371942 and included five films 

spanning from snow white and the 

seven dwarfs to bambi the arrival of 

wwii cut the golden age short bring
ing in budget cuts and floppy films that 

nearly destroyed the disney company 

but a prescient foray into television and a 
string of good films cinderella alice 
in wonderland saved the company and 

ushered in the disney silver age which 

lasted until walt disneys death in 1966 

after disneys death the company was in 

a state of turmoil so desperate for a guid
ing force that the phrase what would 
walt do became the mantra of the dis
ney offices without walt  and later 

without his brother roy who was by all 

accounts a financial wizard  the disney 

company was on the brink of collapse yet 

again
so what saved disney answer the 
next chapter in disney history the disney 

renaissance
in 1989 the little mermaid kicked 
off the disney renaissance which con
stituted an era marked by technical and 

stylistic innovations masterful storytell
ing and dynamic sympathetic characters 
tarzan released in 1999 is considered 
to be the last film of the renaissance 
period routinely the protagonists of dis
ney renaissance films were misunderstood 

outsiders  think mulan ariel qua
simodo or tarzan  and featured strong 

female leads who were cut from a differ
ent cloth than say sleeping beautys 

released in 1959 briar rose a character 

who infamously only has about 18 lines of 
dialogue in her own movie
beauty and the beast the third film 
of the renaissance period exemplifies 
many of the peak traits of the era and has 

rightly been being hailed as a masterpiece 
for over two decades the iconic ballroom 
scene features a moving 3dimensional 
cgi background that shifts and grows 

as belle and the beast waltz through the 

space this creates an illusion of depth 

that more closely mirrors the effect of a 

camera dollying around them this was 

cuttingedge technology in 1991 and the 

fact that it still holds up so beautifully is 

a testament to the skill of disneys artists 

and technicians
in just over a year a liveaction ver
sion of beauty and the beast starring 

emma watson and dan stevens will be 

hitting theaters if its anything like the 

liveaction cinderella from 2015 itll 

be a carboncopy of the animated film 

but with more substantial characters 

and an intriguing story the beauty and 

the beast reboot should have a stronger 
foundation than its liveaction predeces

sor
the protagonist belle is a far cry from 
snow white cinderella and sleeping 

beauty  princesses who essentially 

rolled with their stories rather than di

rectly influencing the plot themselves 

watch any of the first three princess films 

and youll be amazed at how the plot just 

happens around the protagonists belle 

on the other hand continued the trend 

started by ariel in the little mermaid 

 theyre two girls who know what they 

want and theyre going to actively fight 

to get it they cause their own problems 

and clean up their own messes also like 

ariel belle is a misunderstood girl who 

yearns for something beyond her provin
cial life belles love of reading cant be 
understated her name may be the french 
word for beauty but shes more than just 
a pretty face  shes got a brain to match 
that beauty belle exemplified a feminist 

trend in animated disney features that 
began with ariel and continued with 
mulan jasmine meg rapunzel elsa and 

a plethora of others
critics and audiences alike loved the 
film beauty and the beast was the first 
animated film to be nominated for a 
best picture oscar a feat which no other 

animated film achieved until 2010 it won 
the golden globe for best picture  mu
sical or comedy in addition to winning 
oscars for best original score and best 
original song for the title song beauty 

and the beast

17superhot
 revitalizes fpss
by adam waldorf
e ability to control time has grabbed 
peoples attention for countless years its a 
concept that is completely bing to human
ity as we can hardly handle time as it comes to 

us now let alone being able to control it how 

would we as a race handle it would we take 

advantage of it or would we make mistakes 
with it in superhot a new game for pc 
mac and xbox one the player is able to control 

time to their whim while annihilating enemies 
at an exhilarating rate 
regarding video games rstperson 
shooters have gone a bit stale ey have 
started to become formulaic as the player sim
ply shoots enemies hides for a bit while their 
health regenerates and rinse and repeat until 

everyone is dead is unoriginality has made 

the entire genre run dry fortunately su
perhot introduces something completely 
new to the genre in this game time only 
moves when you do in other words when 

the player moves everything else in the game 

moves making it so they have to time their 

moves carefully otherwise they could end 

up dead ere is no health regeneration and 
more enemies than imaginable its the players 
job to control time hack and shoot through 

enemies and ultimately emerge victorious
although it is a dicult concept to convey 
well in a video game superhots 
mechanics never seem objectively wrong if 

something goes wrong its entirely the players 

fault for not foreseeing it e gameplay ows 

well throughout the campaign with each 

move needing to be precise in order to survive 

the onslaught of oncoming enemies su
perhot doesnt have a plot really but the 

games primary focus is on gameplay which it 
executes to near perfection
despite its stellar gameplay mechanics 
the game is far from awless one of the big
gest problems is the style of the models in 
the game everything in the game is cubular 

and makes the player feel like theyre in one 

big simulation rather than actually playing 
a game e enemies shatter apart into un
satisfying blocks that quickly disappear so 
its dicult to marvel at the amazing combo 

that could have been executed its also 

painfully short with little replay value as 

a whole it lasts around two hours if youre 
competent at shooters and doesnt really 
reward the gamer much replay value in a 
sense superhot seemed like a one

trick pony amazing for the short playtime 

but ultimately not warranting any reason to 

come back to it 
superhot is mechanically beautiful 
it lets gamers bob and weave through enemy 

bullets controlling time in a precise fashion 

unfortunately the game does have its short
comings feeling like a simulation and being 

over incredibly quickly although the game is 

loads of fun to play it doesnt provide enough 

gameplay to warrant the 25 price tag hope
fully the developer takes what theyve accom
plished in this game and is able to develop it 

into a fulllength game with characters and 
story to provide a rstperson shooter experi
ence unmatched by any other my recommen
dation regarding superhot is to wait 

until summer time when steam puts it on sale 

for 15 if they put it on sale with that price

tag it denitely warrants a purchase

bartender editiona new player enters the bozeman brewing arena
by rolf tengdin
it can be very easy to get swept up in the 
bozeman brewery scene between outlaw 406 
map bridger and more it can be quite easy to 

overlook the smaller places when you have the 

titans of bozeman lording over you with their 

select brews ere is however a newcomer on 

the stage of the bozeman cra brews bunk
house brewing opened with much fanfare on 

leap day this year and the exciting opening was 

well followed up by high quality beers
e main attraction for any student of msu 
has to be the location situated next door to 

jimmy johns just south of roskie bunkhouse is 

so easily accessible that you may even be on the 

school wifi when you walk in the doors it is 

in the perfect place for when classes get out early 

and you need to forget what you just learned 
e bartenders are not new to the brew
making scene and the quality of the cras 

shows it eir signature stout is known as 

the sheepherder stout a nitropour that is 

as refreshing as it is potent you would not 

be mistaken however to think that their 

signature sabino red is their calling card due 

to its awardwinning avor and its slightly 
undercarbonated taste that helps it go down 

incredibly smooth
e bartenders said the current plan was 
to have one quarterly beer at a time but rotate 

them when the time is right while this may 

not be a new sentiment it is a refreshing one 

when compared to some other brew houses 

abysmal rotation schedules that show that 

they only change their brews once every six 

months where some other local breweries 

have become sort of a corporate establish
ment and every decision feels like it has to be 

approved by a board of directors bunkhouse 

is taking the indie micro brewing scene to the 

next level and doing exactly what feels right 

when it feels right currently bunkhouse is 

running two absolutely phenomenal brews 

in the rotation that are sure to bring even the 

most seasoned beer connoisseurs in to give 

them a try e yearling pale ale has a deep 

malty taste so fresh its as though they grew 

the hops in the backyard of the storefront and 

the long tom porter which was sold out in a 

matter of hours aer they opened their doors
any student that wants to get into the beer 
tasting scene would be remiss to skip bunk
house brewing while it may not be the biggest 
locale in bozeman it comes equipped with 

more than enough charm to compete with the 

giants such as 406 brewing and outlaw and 

the biggest single benet to the bunkhouse is its 

smaller size  because if you are lucky enough 

to go in at the right time you can see the love 

they put into their brews a few mere feet from 

the chairs bunkhouse brewing may be new but 
that doesnt make it any less deserving of your 

attention

   19guac from the gods 
 e easiest most delicious 
party snack ever
by isabel loos
in my world guacamole is the answer 
to everything hungry guacamole 
throwing a party and need an easy 
snack guacamole want to impress 
your parents with the adult things you 
can make when they visit guacamole 

just aced a test guacamole just failed 

a test guacamole you get the idea  

the problem is that it seems as though 

good guacamole is hard to come by 

these days avocado mixed with a little 

lime juice and a bunch of preserva
tives isnt my idea of a good time im 

here to provide you with a recipe that 

is authentic and worthy of being eaten 

while sipping a coconut on the beaches 

of mexico
this is also the perfect easy party 
food for any st patricks day festivities 
coming up it is inexpensive fast and 
easy to prepare and is guaranteed to 
please its easy to make big quantities 
of it as well guac is also a lot healthier 

than many of the common alternative 

party foods like nacho cheese and pizza 

pockets and you can eat a bunch of it 

without feeling fat at all and most im
portantly it is green so you wont have 

to break the theme to have some good 

snacks it might not be an irish dish 

but it is still something people of any 

heritage can enjoy
ingredients
2 ripe avocados
1 tablespoon lime juice

14 red onion chopped
12 ripe tomato chopped
2 tablespoons cilantro chopped

dash of salt and pepper
tortilla chips for dipping
directions
1     mash up the avocado
2     mix everything in

3     devour
 pretty simple right a lot of the measure
ments are just rough estimates so feel free 
to add more or less of something depending 
on what you like i prefer to add a little more 

tomato and onion so it is chunkier you can 

also add chopped chilies if you want to take it 
up to the next level
